title: Before you apply

Graduate-level instruction involves direct supervision
by a member of academic staff.  Applicants to the 
LL.M. and LL.D. programs should therefore carefully
review both the supervision burdens of faculty in their intended
area of study, and any specific reading materials
or preparation suggestions indicated in the faculty
profiles of relevant staff members.

Applicants for subject areas that are heavily subscribed 
should note that admission in these cases is particularly
competitive.  Factors of particular importance in such
cases include:

* Familiarity with existing scholarship in the chosen field;
* A detailed, clear and convincing research
  proposal; and
* A demonstrated track record of independent research
  (evidenced by research papers or academic publications).
