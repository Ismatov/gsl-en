title: 2. Checking out a working copy

###### Step 0

# One-time operation

Note that you only need to go through the steps 
described in this section once;
after you
have a working copy of the website, you can
update it from Subversion to collect changes
to the site made by other people.

###### Step 1

# My Computer
Spaces in pathnames can cause some of the
software to break.  The simplest way around this
small problem for the present is to place the
working copy at the top of the `C:\\` drive,
so that is what we will do.  To find the
`C:\\` drive, open `My Computer` from the
Windows start menu.

###### Step 2

# The `C:\\` drive icon
Open the `C:\\` drive by clicking on it in the `My Computer` 
folder listing.

###### Step 3

# The `C:\\` drive top folder
The illustration to the right shows the
contents of the top-level `C:\\` drive
folder, before doing a Subversion checkout.
We will now do a checkout to create a working
copy on this computer.

###### Step 3

# Requesting a checkout
To request a checkout, click on the right mouse
button inside the `C:\\` folder listing, and
highlight the `SVN Checkout` item.  Releasing
or clicking on this item will start the checkout.

###### Step 3

# Repository path
TurtleSVN will ask you where the Subversion
repository is located.  Enter the address of the
repository in the top field,[^foot1] and add the name of
the new working copy folder after `C:\\` in
the bottom field.  To keep things simple, let's
use the repository name, `gsl-en`, in the bottom
field (so it should read: `C:\\gsl-en`).

[^foot1]: The location for our website is:

    svn+ssh://gsl-nagoya-u.net/home/repo/gsl/trunk/gsl-en/

###### Step 3

![](/en/materials/graphic/man008_checkout_confirmcreate_new.png)

# Confirm directory creation
If the folder you entered into the bottom box
in the previous step does not yet exist (and it shouldn't!),
TurtleSVN will ask whether you want to create it.
Click on `Yes` to confirm that you want to create
the new folder.

###### Step 3

![](/en/materials/graphic/man009_checkout_complete_new.png)

# Checkout!
During checkout, TurtleSVN will show a scrolling list of the
files being added to the working copy folder.
The checkout process may take several minutes,
if very large PDF, Word or graphics files are stored in 
the Subversion repository.  When the checkout is finished,
TurtleSVN will display the revision number of the checkout
in the final line, as shown in the illustration to the right.
You can then click on the `OK` button to close the checkout
window.

###### Step 3

![](/en/materials/graphic/man010_checkout_in_c_new.png)

# The working copy folder
Your new working copy will now be available in
a special folder, marked with a green check-mark
as shown in the illustration to the right.
The green check-mark indicates that you have
not made any changes to your working copy since
the last time it was updated (i.e. since we did
the checkout just now).

###### Step the last

# All done!
You are now ready to begin editing in the working
copy of the website.  As you will see in the next
chapters, the working copy folder is very similar
to an ordinary folder; but it has a few extra
features that we will use to keep the working
copy up to date with the main Subversion 
repository.
