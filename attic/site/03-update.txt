title: 3. Updating from Subversion
css: manual.css

Every editor working on the site has their own
working copy of the website.  Each editor
commits their changes to Subversion separately,
at different times.  Your own working copy
shows *your* changes, of course, including changes
that you have not yet committed.  But whenever you
begin doing editing work, it is a good idea to
update your working copy, to be sure that it
reflects any changes that have been committed
by other editors since your last update.

###### Step 1

# Update in the top folder
TurtleSVN will update all folders *below* the current
folder.  To get a complete update of all files on the
site, you will want to do your update in the top
folder of your working copy.  In our example, this
folder is called `gsl-en`, and is located immediately
below `C:\\`.  The illustration to the right shows this
folder.

###### Step 2

# Running an update
To run an update, just click the right-hand mouse
button, and select the `SVN Update` item from the
menu.

# Update report
TurtleSVN will
pop up a window and display the listing as the
updates are made to your working copy, ending in
a line telling the version number in the
repository.  If there
are no files to update, the display will look
like the illustration shown to the right.

Note that an update may take a little time,
depending on how many files need to be changed.
