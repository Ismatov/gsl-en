# Refresh the file browser
After an update or commit operation, the icons
in the file browser may not show the current
state of the files and folders in the working
copy.  To be sure you have correct information
on the status of the content, use the file
browser refresh feature, which is available under
the right-click mouse menu as shown in the
illustration to the right.
