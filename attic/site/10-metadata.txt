title: B. Metadata fields

# Field names

In addition to the required `title:` field, a
few metadata header fields are available to control 
the appearance of pages on the site. These are
explained here.

banner-image:
: This is used to set the banner image for
this page.  The image will be inherited by
any "children", if this field is set in an
`index.txt` file.

css:
: This is used to set a special style of the page.
Normally you will not need to use this field;
but if you have special formatting requirements
for a particular page, the field can be used
to set a custom stylesheet.  The only custom stylesheet
available at present is `manual.css`.

javascript:
: This is used to set a Javascript library for use
in the current page.  Normally you will not need
to use this field.

title:
: This field is for the title of the page.  It is 
required.
