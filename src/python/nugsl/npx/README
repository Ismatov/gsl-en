batang-i.box
  This file was hacked to work around three FATALITIES for
  symbols not found.  Moving the symbols to another location in
  the graphic and retraining fixed the problem.  Go figure.

batang-r.box
  The graphical glyphs for 平 and 額 needed to be displaced
  slightly to get tess to find them during training.  Same
  solution as for batang-i, less drastic solution.

Several other font files were jiggled around for the same reason.
Some have fonts in a non-standard order as a result.
