The course will begin by a theoretical introduction of the field, teaching basic conceptual notions and providing the students with the elementary methodological tools. Then, based upon a selection of readings, the course intends to help students develop argumentation skills. As students of law and political sciences, students should be able to discuss various topics (human rights, respect of cultures, etc.) under a technical perspective, using legal reasoning and being able to argument objectively.","Due to the peculiar nature of the seminar, there is no need of a general textbook for students. Lessons will be based on readings that will be distributed to students in advance.",Tamura/Colombo,,"This course is aimed to look at legal issues from a cross-cultural, comparative and pluralistic perspective. The course will comprise both a theoretical explanation of the field and its historical evolution, but will largely focus on contemporary and highly debated themes like legal pluralism, dispute resolution and access to justice, human rights, cultural defense. Notions like ""law"", ""justice"", ""sanction"", etc. will be analyzed in context, to show students that the idea of law as merely legal order imposed from the State could be limiting if not misleading.

This is done by examining a number of areas, namely Article 9 of the Constitution, Criminal Law and Procedure, Nationality, and Family Law. Within each area, some of the most relevant rules and institutions are selected, and they are studied not only in and by themselves, but taking into account their social, economic, and political foundations, as well as by comparing them to similar rules and institutions in other countries. </p>
<p>The course is designed with non-law students in mind, and is therefore accessible to those with no or little previous university-level experience in this field. An effort is made to highlight issues that are relevant for a wide future range of careers, including, but not limited to, business, public service, diplomacy, and national security.</p>

In addition, they have to complete a written assignment and prepare and deliver an oral presentation. All of these, together with a final exam, will contribute to students' final grades. Students will be provided with a list of possible topics for their research essays and can suggest others, subject to approval. The final exam will consist of two sections, one with multiple-choice questions and another one with essay-type questions.</p>
<p>Lectures and seminars will mainly take place on Wednesdays (fourth period), but some will be held on Wednesdays (first period).</p>
<p>The materials for this course will be provided in electronic format. Students are expected to follow current events in Japan by regularly reading a quality newspaper. They also check their e-mail regularly since the course convenor may send them additional materials.</p>
<p>By the end of the course students will have gained a basic understanding of some key areas of the Japanese legal system, and understood their social, economic, and political foundations. They will have compared them with similar ones in other countries. In addition, they will have gained some exposure to legal thought and techniques, and deepened their understanding of contemporary Japan. This will improve their capability of engaging with the country at all levels, from business and personal to diplomacy.

Reading and discussing them should provide students with the opportunity to explore some of the legal foundations of international relations, and of the international financial markets. Students are expected to be active participants in class, since the course is based on active learning, reading, and comprehension, rather than the mere passive study of texts.</p>
<p>The course runs in parallel with Contemporary Japanese Law I, and students taking both should be able to combine the knowledge and skills gained. However, they are designed as independent courses and neither requires students to be following the other.</p>
<p>The first part of the course deals with private law documents. We shall begin with an examination of contracts, including the concept of a contract and an outline of its elements in the English Common Law. This will take us first to the contracts used to charter ships, followed by insurance. Next we will deal with legal documentation in the international financial markets, with a closer look at some derivatives. After some time for review, a mid-term exam will be held on all these topics.</p>
<p>We will then turn our attention to public international law, and some of the kinds of documents often encountered in that arena. We will begin with treaties, and an overview of their nature and place in the sources of International Law. This will be followed by a closer look at UNCLOS and the concept of the Exclusive Economic Zone. We shall next examine the Philippines' arbitration case against China at a seminar, both to learn more about UNCLOS and as an introduction to arbitration. </p>
<p>The course is designed with non-law students in mind, and is therefore accessible to those with no or little previous university-level experience in this field. An effort is made to highlight issues that are relevant for a wide future range of careers, including, but not limited to, business, public service, diplomacy, and national security.</p>

In addition, they have to complete a written assignment and prepare and deliver and oral presentation. All of these, together with a mid-term exam, participation in class, and a final exam, will contribute to students' final grades. Students will be sent some possible presentation topics but are encouraged to suggest one themselves, subject to approval by their course convenor. The mid-term exam will be multiple-choice, while the final exam will consist of a mixture of multiple-choice questions and essay-type questions. </p>
<p>Lectures and seminars will take place on Thursdays (3rd period),  but also sometimes on Wednesdays (1st period).</p>
<p>The materials for this course will be provided in electronic format. Students are expected to follow current events in Japan and worldwide by regularly reading a quality newspaper. In particular, they should make an effort to follow any developments related to the topics included in the syllabus. They should also check their e-mail regularly, since the course convenor may send notices concerning the development of the course, or share relevant news or materials with students.</p>
<p>By the end of the course students will have been exposed to a range of legal materials, from both the private and public spheres. This will have contributed to their understanding of the law and the context in which it operates. It will also provide a foundation for the use of legal documentation in their future careers, be they in the private sector or in public service. Concerning the non-specific skills that students will reinforce, they include reading comprehension, summing up of texts both orally and in writing, public speaking, and written expression.</p>",Fall,TBA,Students are recommended to read UNCLOS in advance.,,,,Thu 13:00-14:30,2,2,0,Courses

We will then consider some currently debated issues in Japanese family law, including the existence of discrimination between legitimate child and illegitimate child in determining the division of property in succession, and issues related to artificial reproductive technology (ART).  We will find out how the traditional concept of a parent-child relationship remains and appears even as society itself seems like to have been radically changed through the influences of Western culture.<br />
</p>
<p>Secondly, students will do a further survey of the wider Asian perspective with samples from South Asian and South East Asian countries where the application of religious and customary laws remains important, creating conflicts with general laws.  The conflicts of such legal systems come from the adoption or transplantation of the legal systems of the suzerain states.

</p>
<p>We will learn how a particular society had grown its indigenous law, and then how they have maintained it by adopting foreign systems before discussing future directions it might take.

The first Diplomatic Bluebook issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (MOFA) in 1957 specified three principles underpinning Japanese foreign policy: close cooperation with Western countries, international cooperation through United Nations activities and adherence to Japan's position as an Asian country. In the lecture students will examine whether these principles in postwar Japanese diplomacy have been subject to either changes in priority or friction.",,M Sadakata,,"<p>The lecture first traces the historical evolution of Japanese diplomacy during the Cold War and post-Cold War periods. It then proceeds to look at various characteristics of Japanese diplomacy and the rationale on which it is premised. Finally, it evaluates Japanese diplomacy in the context of the current international political environment. <br />
</p>
<p>Postwar Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>Immediately after the Second World War, Japan's defeat against the allied forces prevented it from adopting an explicit foreign policy. Occupation authorities were tasked with demilitarizing and democratizing Japanese society, and this led to the Constitution of 1946, which became the centerpiece of the democratization of Japan. However, after the beginning of the Cold war in Asia, Japan took on a different role in the US's Asian strategy. In 1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan and the Japan-US Security Treaty were both signed on the same date in San Francisco. </p>
<p>The Yoshida Doctrine and Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>It is safe to say that the Yoshida Doctrine eventually emerged as the most important pillar of postwar Japanese diplomacy. It placed absolute priority on economic recovery and development, while simultaneously maintaining a low-key diplomatic profile and leaving Japan's national defense largely in the hands of the United States. Successive governments of postwar Japan were forced to accept the international environment as a fait accompli and hope the American security system would hold up. </p>
<p>Japanese Diplomacy toward Asian countries</p>
<p>On the other hand, Japan's diplomacy toward Asian countries at the time was largely based on an economic policy in the form of its ODA programs, rather than a genuine foreign policy. Especially for East Asian neighbors, the Japan-US Security Treaty posed a threat to regional stability and cooperation in Asia. Despite these conditions, the Fukuda Doctrine of 1977 pledged that Japan would never again become a military power and that Japan would build up relationship of mutual trust with Southeast Asian countries, via the so-called ""hear- to-heart"" diplomacy.   <br />
</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War and Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War called into question the purpose of the security alliance with the United States. However, while policymakers advocated a transformation of the alliance, Japanese diplomacy in fact increasingly emphasized the importance of the bilateral relationship with the United States. The Koizumi cabinet, for example, actively supported American military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and dispatched SDF troops to both conflict zones in a surprising departure from Japan's longstanding policy of not deploying military forces overseas.<br />
</p>
<p>In the lecture, students will gain a clear perspective on Japanese diplomacy in the 21th century and be able to evaluate how Japanese diplomacy has genuinely contributed to stability and prosperity in Asia, and in East Asia in particular.</p>",Spring,TBA,,,,,Mon 10:30-12:00,2,1&amp;2,0,Courses

Each class will consist of a mix of lecture and class discussion of an issue related to law and globalization.  There will be assigned reading each week and students will be expected to come to class prepared to actively discuss the topic that week.  Student participation in class discussions will constitute 30% of the final grade.  There will be no student presentations in this class, rather the remainder of the grade will be determined by a 10-20 page academic essay.The purpose of this class is to familiarize students with contemporary issues in global politics and economy. It will do this by requiring students to read from a selection of both on-line international newspaper publications and on-line global broadcast networks in English. Students choose political and economic issues they are interested in. They read the articles or stories and come to the class prepared to discuss the issue of their choice. The class aims to facilitate discussion on global political and economic issues while sharpening the ability of students to make short presentations as they introduce their chosen issue to the class.",,Tamura/MacGinty,,"<p>Traditionally legal systems have been conceived as creatures of the nation-state.  At the domestic level the state is given exclusive sovereignty to create, enforce and adjudicate laws that apply within its physical borders.  In terms of the international legal order, states are both the creators of public international law through treaties and traditionally were the sole subjects of that body of law.<br />
</p>
<p>A variety of social, economic, technological and political trends which are generally associated with the notion of <code>globalization</code> have in recent years fundamentally altered the state-centred paradigm of the law.  The increased flow of goods, capital, communications and people across borders has contributed to new challenges which individual states have difficulty regulating on their own.  This has created an impetus towards regulating many issues at the international rather than　the  national level.  Additionally, the benefits of collective action in some areas provide states with a positive incentive to regulate such issues in an international forum rather than domestically. </p>
<p>In this course we will explore the above noted trends in a selected group of fields which demonstrate the ways in which international law and domestic law interact to address these problems.   These range from major global issues which require collective action at the international level to avert potentially catastrophic outcomes - like climate change - to more niche areas in which interesting legal issues are being debated like the cross border protection of cultural property.</p>",Spring,911,,,,,Fri 16:30-18:00,2,1&amp;2,0,Courses

<p>This seminar focuses on both theoretical and practical issues related to the Moot. This year (2014) case will be studied in detail. Starting from that, students will have to prepare the case (doing research and collecting materials), develop a defensive strategy and learn the basic skills of oral advocacy in arbitration.

This lecture substantially weighs on ""experience and involvement"" in many judicial spots and scenes in Japan. You will explore the inside and outside of Nagoya Keimusho(=jail), visit Nagoya District Court to meet and talk with a judge and a court secretary in a real court room, and call on Aichi Bengoshikai(=the bar association) to encoutner both new and estabilished practioners, as well as to have study aways to Osu and Toho Gas co., Ltd. Also, you will be highly expected to play an essential part in the moot criminal court, choosing either a judge, a prosecuter, a defense counsel, or witness, or make a presentation on your reserch from comparative approach. <br />
</p>
<p>It is not essential to have some background knowledge in Japanese judicial systems or Japanese laws. However, it is of paramount importance to be full of interest and passion for your study and to participate in class discussions and study aways, and just enjoy your explorations positively and spontaneously throughout this course. The class is conducted mainly in English. Also, if your guest speaker is not used to English, English translation is always followed. However, you are also expected to acquire and understand relevant Japanese legal terminologies. If you know some of these, your study through this lecture will always be more productive and fulfilling.</p>",,Mr. Akitsuyu Ogawa,Yes,"<p>本講義は、日本についてほとんど知らないという状況のまま入学している本コース留学生に、日本社会、日本法についての概括的な情報を提供するために、弁護士の方と名大の教員が協力して、裁判所、検察庁、弁護士会、法務関連機関、企業等の訪問を軸に、日本の法制度の学習を行い、それらの総合学習を踏まえ、自国の制度と社会と比較し、自国の未来を展望するレポートを提出させるという、講義と実地見学を組み合わせた講義です。</p>
<p>講義では、資料の予習、実地見学前の概説、実地見学、見学に基づく質疑応答、自分の国の制度との比較を通じた自国の法と社会のより的確な理解を深めることを目標とています。日本社会と日本法を知るための実地見学を本講義ではかなり重視しています。講義の達成目標は、半年の講義で日本の社会と法制度の全体像について、一定の実感をもってもらうことです。　</p>
<p>It would appear that the overseas students entering the LL.M. in Comparative Law Program (English-taught program) arrive knowing very little about Japan. However, the curriculum of this course deals with advanced theories of law in each of its lecture series with a lack of explanations for those new to Japanese law and society.　Therefore, to give overseas students some general information regarding Japan, this course is run, in conjunction with the Aichi Prefectural Bar Association (International Special Committee) and the teaching staff of Nagoya University.</p>
<p>Lectures are given in conjunction with onsite visits (around half the time for each. Several lectures are taken). The lectures consist of the prior study of relevant materials, explanations before visits, question and answer sessions based on the visits, and the comparison of the system in Japan with one's own country so as to further one's understanding of the law and society of one's country. It is important that the onsite visits become the core part of the lectures so as to enhance one's knowledge of Japanese society and law.</p>
<p>Emerged in this varied learning experience, students make comparisons with their own countries' system and society, and submit reports on the future perspective they have for their country. Over the course of a half year of lectures, students will be given a vivid impression of the overall shape of Japanese society and the legal system.</p>",2 2,GSL Building 905,good English skills,,,"Mr. Hirano, Mr. Tanabe, Mr. Ichihashi, Mr. Hayakawa","Thu. 4th period, 2:45pm to 4:15pm",2,Master 1st year,0,Courses

</ul>",,Introduction to Joint Research on Comparative Study of Law,Lecture,"<p>This workshop is designed for students in law and in politics to learn in a collaborative setting how to do research from a comparative perspective. It revolves around two main features. </p>
<p>First, by focusing on the ""Comparative Study of Law"" broadly conceived rather than on ""Comparative Law"" in the narrow sense, it makes students more knowledgeable about various comparative methods applicable to a wide range of legal institutions at different regulatory levels and in different contexts. Students are able to explore and compare multiple legal norms, rules and principles that stem from diverse public and private rule-making entities at local, national and international levels. </p>
<p>Second, by prioritizing ""Joint Research"", this workshop creates a learning environment that is conducive to the learning of basic research skills following an original pattern. It gives students with divergent national, linguistic and academic backgrounds the opportunity both to step away from soloist and monodisciplinary types of comparativism, and to cease thinking in terms of a single national legal paradigm. In such an international and collaborative setting, students are stimulated to exchange a variety of perspectives. Rather than concentrating on simply executing a standard procedure of doing research, they are challenged - through teamwork and cooperative learning - to explore innovative formulas to study law comparatively, to construct their own understanding of the law from multiple sources, and to elaborate workable alternative solutions to real-world problems.</p>
<p>Small-scale, student-centred, based on complementary teaching methods and learning styles (lectures, discussions with reading assignments before classes, case studies, project- and problem-based assignment tasks), this workshop equips pluralistic legal-minded students with a ""tool-box"" on which they can draw in a creative manner to actually engage in comparative legal research and better navigate today's complex and rapidly transforming legal landscape. Through focusing on the process of learning, rather than the mere content to be learned, this ""Introduction to Joint Research on Comparative Study of Law"" should allow students to develop the capability of applying, not only possessing, knowledge that can be used in various contextualized settings. The basics acquired through such workshop relate to a wide range of transferable skills* to be developed further through the overall Leading Program. </p>
<ul>
<li>Such as the ability to undertake a critical analysis of legal concepts and institutions across systems; an appreciation of legal pluralism and varying forms of normativity; the ability to identify and resolve theoretical and practical problems concerning the application of law in multi-jurisdictional situations; and the capacity to place law and regulation, irrespective of subject area, within a global context.</li>

Significantly, a methodologically sound approach to comparative law and research is now considered to be crucial in the production of a growing body of critical understanding of legal matters in the era of globalization. And clear guidelines are deemed necessary, especially at a time when young students engage more often than in the past in legal research conducted on a comparative basis.</p>
<p>Addressing the question of how to carry out comparative legal research, this workshop explores the main methodological traditions and their practical implications in comparing different legal institutions in a multifaceted, globalized world. It introduces students to both an overarching methodological framework (consisting of a series of steps that need to be taken to perform any comparative legal research project) and a wide range of various comparative ""techniques"" that have developed over time by trial and error. All together, its 7 sessions form a plea for a comprehensive approach to methodology regarding the comparative study of law. </p>
<p>The first part of this workshop will consist of a theoretical inquiry in established, as well as more innovative, comparative law methods. We will critically discuss these methods and study how to apply them to the most controversial issues in current legal debates (Sessions 1 and 2). Then, we will turn our attention to the impact of globalization on legal systems and will challenge the relevance of the comparative law method in addressing today's larger, complex web of overlapping, competing and conflicting legal sources (Sessions 3 to 5). Composed of two training sessions, the second part will focus on legal research basic skills development. Through collaborative and open research assignments, students will learn both how to rely on a comprehensive framework of comparative legal research and to confront a variety of possible methodological choices. Devoted respectively to problem-based and project-based assignment tasks, Session 6 and Session 7 will allow students to engage with comparative study of law in such a way that research processes are internalised rather than being conveyed by a top-down approach.</p>",Fall,Leading satellite room,"There is no substantive knowledge requirement for taking the course.

<p>unarmed protesters in the eastern city of Andijan on May 13, 2005, following prison attacks by armed men.</p>
<p>Divergent views persist today with regard to this Andijan tragedy in the</p>
<p>context of human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>The position taken by the Uzbek government, supported by Russia, China and countries in Central Asia, places the blame on the terrorists. It claims that the armed group belonged to the terrorists group known as Akramia - a faction of the illegal Hizb-ut-Tahri (an Islam fundamentalist Party), which sought to establish an Islamic State refusing to accept human rights and democracy. They attacked the prison and used citizens as human shield while attempting to withdraw. That was how the gun battle started and they should be held responsible for the deaths. Uzbekistan has no choice but to respond to ""violence"" by the Islamic fundamentalists, who reject human rights and democracy, with equal ""violence"". The argument states that, for a premature secular state that had gained independence for merely 20 years, any response to ""violence"" by means of respects for human rights and democracy would lead to the demise of the State and therefore the ends of human rights and democracy. (Cry like a wolf when living with the wolf).</p>
<p>Against this first view, countries in the West and international human</p>
<p>rights NGOs come up with their critical arguments that human rights have</p>
<p>been violated in Uzbekistan under the pretext of fighting terrorism led by</p>
<p>the Islamic fundamentalists. Even a young independent State of 20 years old</p>
<p>has the duty to respect human rights and democracy. Notwithstanding the</p>
<p>future goal of human rights and democracy, ""violence"" in response to</p>
<p>""violence"" will create a vicious circle of violence and hatred. The future goal will never be achievable.</p>
<p>Six years after the Andijan tragedy, this criticism against Uzbekistan has not changed. For example, the Human Rights Watch includes the following</p>
<p>wordings in its 2012 World Report: Uzbekistan's human rights record remains appalling, with no meaningful improvements in 2011. Torture remains endemic in the criminal justice system. Authorities continue to target civil society activists, opposition members, and journalists, and to persecute religious believers who worship outside strict state controls.</p>
<p>What should be the appropriate way for Uzbekistan, a State in the process</p>
<p>of building and the front line of the war against terror, to develop its own goals of human rights and democracy?

Final report (50%).",,Asian Family Law,lecture,"<p>We will first take a general look at traditional Chinese family law and how it spread to surrounding areas including the Korean peninsula and Japan.  We will compare the differences between indigenous Japanese and Korean family law.  Though both received the influence of traditional Chinese family law their laws developed slightly differently due to variances in the cultures of each.  While both countries have modified their own legal systems using first Chinese and later ""modern"" systems from abroad this process did not constitute a total replacement of the older systems with newer, more advanced ones.</p>
<p>Secondly we will discuss issues related to South Asian family law, comparing India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other surrounding countries.  Religions such as Hinduism and Islam have had a great influence on the Indian subcontinent and religious and customary laws are applied to family issues.  The general legal system that has been transplanted from European countries co-exists in these countries with personal laws and the choice of applicable law is often permitted in family matters.  The big issues to be discussed in these lectures will include whether the European influenced systems of general law should over-ride customary laws, whether family laws should be uniformed, and whether and how ""international standards"" on the protection of human rights should be introduced when they seem to conflict with personal laws.</p>",,H Ito,Yes,"The purpose of this course is to allow students to develop the skills needed to understand foreign legal systems and search for better ways of building appropriate legal systems for different communities using comparative techniques.  This series of lectures focuses mainly on East and South Asia.  Because ""Asia"" is a vast region with a multitude of cultural backgrounds we do not have a clear definition of the term ""Asian law"". Not many universities in the world provide courses on ""Asian law"" at either the undergraduate or graduate level. The term is often used to refer simply to Chinese law, even in Asia, or Indian law as it is in the United Kingdom.  In this course we use East Asia in order to understand contemporary Japanese law more clearly and South Asia in order to gain a better understanding of the reality surrounding the application of religious laws.  During the course of these lectures we will learn how to locate proper sources, a skill that is essential in finding the applicable law and solving conflict of law problems.  An example of this would be finding the conditions necessary for a valid marriage in the case of a mixed marriage.",Fall,Leader's satellite room,"<p>A basic knowledge of Family Law and Private International Law are recommended.</p>

We will take an expansive view of law and justice, recognizing that in many contexts, they also border on political, cultural and socio-economic issues. Putting these into perspective, we will analyze how development practitioners have tried to devise innovative and creative ways to keep up with the changing and expanding needs of today's world and the different initiatives that back these efforts. </p>
<p>As an international financial institution with a development mandate, the World Bank has been involved in a great deal of these efforts―as an institution and, sometimes, in partnership with other institutions. We will take a critical look at some of the World Bank's development initiatives, especially in the area of justice reform. We will also look at case studies of a few projects, focusing on the policies and procedures of the Bank, the project cycle, and development approaches. In doing these, we will examine successes and failures, challenges faced and lessons learned, as well as current trends and prospects for the future for both the Bank and the development field in general.
