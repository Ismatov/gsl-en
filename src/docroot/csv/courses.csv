<p>Reports: 20%</p>",2013-04-15,Contemporary Japanese Diplomacy (E),,"This lecture discusses the development of Japanese diplomacy since the end of the Second World War, and aims to deepen students' understanding of the characteristics of post-war Japanese diplomacy and how successive governments have perceived Japan's national interests as a whole. The first Diplomatic Bluebook issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (MOFA) in 1957 specified three principles underpinning Japanese foreign policy: close cooperation with Western countries, international cooperation through United Nations activities and adherence to Japan's position as an Asian country. In the lecture students will examine whether these principles in postwar Japanese diplomacy have been subject to either changes in priority or friction.",,M Sadakata,,"<p>The lecture first traces the historical evolution of Japanese diplomacy during the Cold War and post-Cold War periods. It then proceeds to look at various characteristics of Japanese diplomacy and the rationale on which it is premised. Finally, it evaluates Japanese diplomacy in the context of the current international political environment. <br />
</p>
<p>Postwar Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>Immediately after the Second World War, Japan's defeat against the allied forces prevented it from adopting an explicit foreign policy. Occupation authorities were tasked with demilitarizing and democratizing Japanese society, and this led to the Constitution of 1946, which became the centerpiece of the democratization of Japan. However, after the beginning of the Cold war in Asia, Japan took on a different role in the US's Asian strategy. In 1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan and the Japan-US Security Treaty were both signed on the same date in San Francisco. </p>
<p>The Yoshida Doctrine and Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>It is safe to say that the Yoshida Doctrine eventually emerged as the most important pillar of postwar Japanese diplomacy. It placed absolute priority on economic recovery and development, while simultaneously maintaining a low-key diplomatic profile and leaving Japan's national defense largely in the hands of the United States. Successive governments of postwar Japan were forced to accept the international environment as a fait accompli and hope the American security system would hold up. </p>
<p>Japanese Diplomacy toward Asian countries</p>
<p>On the other hand, Japan's diplomacy toward Asian countries at the time was largely based on an economic policy in the form of its ODA programs, rather than a genuine foreign policy. Especially for East Asian neighbors, the Japan-US Security Treaty posed a threat to regional stability and cooperation in Asia. Despite these conditions, the Fukuda Doctrine of 1977 pledged that Japan would never again become a military power and that Japan would build up relationship of mutual trust with Southeast Asian countries, via the so-called ""hear- to-heart"" diplomacy.   <br />
</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War and Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War called into question the purpose of the security alliance with the United States. However, while policymakers advocated a transformation of the alliance, Japanese diplomacy in fact increasingly emphasized the importance of the bilateral relationship with the United States. The Koizumi cabinet, for example, actively supported American military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and dispatched SDF troops to both conflict zones in a surprising departure from Japan's longstanding policy of not deploying military forces overseas.<br />
</p>
<p>In the lecture, students will gain a clear perspective on Japanese diplomacy in the 21th century and be able to evaluate how Japanese diplomacy has genuinely contributed to stability and prosperity in Asia, and in East Asia in particular.</p>",Spring,404/405 (Bunkei Sougoukan 4F),,,,,Mon 10:30-12:00,2,1&amp;2,0,Courses

This lecture substantially weighs on ""experience and involvement"" in many judicial spots and scenes in Japan. You will explore the inside and outside of Nagoya Keimusho(=jail), visit Nagoya District Court to meet and talk with a judge and a court secretary in a real court room, and call on Aichi Bengoshikai(=the bar association) to encoutner both new and estabilished practioners, as well as to have study aways to Osu and Toho Gas co., Ltd. Also, you will be highly expected to play an essential part in the moot criminal court, choosing either a judge, a prosecuter, a defense counsel, or witness, or make a presentation on your reserch from comparative approach. <br />
</p>
<p>It is not essential to have some background knowledge in Japanese judicial systems or Japanese laws. However, it is of paramount importance to be full of interest and passion for your study and to participate in class discussions and study aways, and just enjoy your explorations positively and spontaneously throughout this course. The class is conducted mainly in English. Also, if your guest speaker is not used to English, English translation is always followed. However, you are also expected to acquire and understand relevant Japanese legal terminologies. If you know some of these, your study through this lecture will always be more productive and fulfilling.</p>",,A Ogawa,,"<p>本講義は、日本についてほとんど知らないという状況のまま入学している本コース留学生に、日本社会、日本法についての概括的な情報を提供するために、弁護士の方と名大の教員が協力して、裁判所、検察庁、弁護士会、法務関連機関、企業等の訪問を軸に、日本の法制度の学習を行い、それらの総合学習を踏まえ、自国の制度と社会と比較し、自国の未来を展望するレポートを提出させるという、講義と実地見学を組み合わせた講義です。</p>

<p>It would appear that the overseas students entering the LL.M. in Comparative Law Program (English-taught program) arrive knowing very little about Japan. However, the curriculum of this course deals with advanced theories of law in each of its lecture series with a lack of explanations for those new to Japanese law and society.　Therefore, to give overseas students some general information regarding Japan, this course is run, in conjunction with the Aichi Prefectural Bar Association (International Special Committee) and the teaching staff of Nagoya University.</p>
<p>Lectures are given in conjunction with onsite visits (around half the time for each. Several lectures are taken). The lectures consist of the prior study of relevant materials, explanations before visits, question and answer sessions based on the visits, and the comparison of the system in Japan with one's own country so as to further one's understanding of the law and society of one's country. It is important that the onsite visits become the core part of the lectures so as to enhance one's knowledge of Japanese society and law.</p>
<p>Emerged in this varied learning experience, students make comparisons with their own countries' system and society, and submit reports on the future perspective they have for their country. Over the course of a half year of lectures, students will be given a vivid impression of the overall shape of Japanese society and the legal system.</p>",Fall,Integrated Research Building 408,good English skills,,,"Hirano, Tanabe, Ichihashi, Hayakawa",Thu 14:45 to 16:15,2,M1,0,Courses

At present, there is no textbook in the English language on contemporary issues of comparative law or comparative legal studies. Traditional introductory books first cover the aims, purposes, uses and methodology of comparative law, after which students are introduced to the major legal systems and prominent 'legal families'. Times have changed however, and other topics are of crucial importance today. The purpose of this class is to fill this gap in comparative law teaching and study. It enables students to discuss current relevant debates and issues such as convergence/non-convergence, law in context (culture and economics), cultural distinctiveness, globalism versus localism, systems in transition, the use of comparative law by the judges and the role of comparative law in law reform activities and harmonization, public law comparisons (both in administrative law and constitutional law), the 'common core' and the 'better law' approaches, comparative commercial law and international contracts, and comparative law looking beyond the Western world. Students will be placed firmly in the contemporary picture. They will be able both to discuss critically the traditional areas and to access current issues presented by well-known academics and field experts.","<p>Several textbooks are used. Copies of the most relevant passages or abstracts to be discussed will distributed to the students on a regular basis, via the online syllabus system.</p>
<p>In addition to the classical sources in the field, other sources will be used such as: ""The Oxford Handbook of Comparative Law"", ""The Elgar Encyclopedia of Comparative Law"", and other ""Handbooks"" (""Comparative Law, A Hanbook"", E. Orucu, D. Nelken, 2007; etc.).</p>",D Yokomizo,Yes,"<p>Comparative law has become a more significant area for legal research. A discipline with a long and reverent history such as comparative law is presently characterized by an important new dynamic that is taking it into new directions. This course focuses on what is significantly new and particular about the way comparative law is approached, employed and practiced today. It puts light on three significant new trends from a research perspective. First, it questions how far the growing demand for comparative law in a globalised world - and the increased interest in it from neighbouring disciplines (legal sociology, legal history, law and economics, etc.) - has triggered critical reflection on the discipline's theory and methodology. Second, by analyzing distinctive 'subject areas' of comparative law, it questions the expansion of its domain and the way the boundaries between public and private law are progressively blurring today. Third, it questions the role of the discipline in an era of both 'regionalisation' and 'globalisation', where national law coexists and interacts with supranational and international law. </p>
<p>Commencing with a general introduction and a critical overview, the course moves on to contemporary and burgeoning areas of comparative law. Through the lenses of such transforming discipline, this course addresses from the very start to the end the many ways law is crossing borders today and, consequently, its new frontiers. Taking the pulse of these new dynamics in comparative law, the readings proposed (in English) contribute to the necessary dialogue between scholars 'doing' comparative law and scholars 'theorising' about it.</p>",Fall,unfixed,"A good command of the English language (reading, speaking and writing) is required. A basic knowledge in comparative law and comparative legal studies is also a prerequisite.",,,I Giraudou,TBA,2,M1,0,Courses

In the process, the course gives special attention to the kinds of knowledge and inquiry appropriate to each phase of the policy process.
