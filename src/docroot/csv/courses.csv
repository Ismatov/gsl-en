Reading and discussing them should provide students with the opportunity to explore some of the legal foundations of international relations, and of the international financial markets. Students are expected to be active participants in class, since the course is based on active learning, reading, and comprehension, rather than the mere passive study of texts.</p>
<p>The course runs in parallel with Contemporary Japanese Law I, and students taking both should be able to combine the knowledge and skills gained. However, they are designed as independent courses and neither requires students to be following the other.</p>
<p>The first part of the course deals with private law documents. We shall begin with an examination of contracts, including the concept of a contract and an outline of its elements in the English Common Law. This will take us first to the contracts used to charter ships, followed by insurance. A workshop will give students the chance to gain some practice in the actual negotiation and drafting of contracts. This part will conclude with a look at some documents used in the international financial markets. After some time for review, a mid-term exam will be held on all these topics.</p>
<p>We will then turn our attention to public international law, and some of the kinds of documents often encountered in that arena. We will begin with treaties, and an overview of their nature and place in the sources of International Law. This will be followed by a closer look at UNCLOS. We shall next examine the Philippines' arbitration case against China, both to learn more about UNCLOS and as an introduction to arbitration. A brief look at NATO and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization will complete this topic. Maritime border delimitation will also be covered in a seminar on the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>We will then shift to the International Court of Justice and some of the documents emanating from it. This will include a brief examination of its role and working. The course will conclude with an outline of the laws of war and the Geneva Conventions.</p>

<p>Students are expected to read course materials in advance of the relevant lecture, and to engage in active discussion in the seminars. In addition, they have to complete different assignments.

<p>The materials for this course will be provided in electronic format. Students are expected to follow current events in Japan and worldwide by regularly reading a quality newspaper. In particular, they should make an effort to follow any developments related to the topics included in the syllabus.</p>
<p>By the end of the course students will have been exposed to a range of legal materials, from both the private and public spheres. This will have contributed to their understanding of the law and the context in which it operates. It will also provide a foundation for the use of legal documentation in their future careers, be they in the private sector or in public service. Concerning the non-specific skills that students will reinforce, they include reading comprehension, summing up of texts both orally and in writing, public speaking, and written expression.</p>",Fall,TBA,Students are recommended to read UNCLOS in advance.,,,,Wed 14:45-16:15,2,2,0,Courses

The first Diplomatic Bluebook issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (MOFA) in 1957 specified three principles underpinning Japanese foreign policy: close cooperation with Western countries, international cooperation through United Nations activities and adherence to Japan's position as an Asian country. In the lecture students will examine whether these principles in postwar Japanese diplomacy have been subject to either changes in priority or friction.",,M Sadakata,,"<p>The lecture first traces the historical evolution of Japanese diplomacy during the Cold War and post-Cold War periods. It then proceeds to look at various characteristics of Japanese diplomacy and the rationale on which it is premised. Finally, it evaluates Japanese diplomacy in the context of the current international political environment. <br />
</p>
<p>Postwar Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>Immediately after the Second World War, Japan's defeat against the allied forces prevented it from adopting an explicit foreign policy. Occupation authorities were tasked with demilitarizing and democratizing Japanese society, and this led to the Constitution of 1946, which became the centerpiece of the democratization of Japan. However, after the beginning of the Cold war in Asia, Japan took on a different role in the US's Asian strategy. In 1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan and the Japan-US Security Treaty were both signed on the same date in San Francisco. </p>
<p>The Yoshida Doctrine and Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>It is safe to say that the Yoshida Doctrine eventually emerged as the most important pillar of postwar Japanese diplomacy. It placed absolute priority on economic recovery and development, while simultaneously maintaining a low-key diplomatic profile and leaving Japan's national defense largely in the hands of the United States. Successive governments of postwar Japan were forced to accept the international environment as a fait accompli and hope the American security system would hold up. </p>
<p>Japanese Diplomacy toward Asian countries</p>
<p>On the other hand, Japan's diplomacy toward Asian countries at the time was largely based on an economic policy in the form of its ODA programs, rather than a genuine foreign policy. Especially for East Asian neighbors, the Japan-US Security Treaty posed a threat to regional stability and cooperation in Asia. Despite these conditions, the Fukuda Doctrine of 1977 pledged that Japan would never again become a military power and that Japan would build up relationship of mutual trust with Southeast Asian countries, via the so-called ""hear- to-heart"" diplomacy.   <br />
</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War and Japanese Diplomacy</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War called into question the purpose of the security alliance with the United States. However, while policymakers advocated a transformation of the alliance, Japanese diplomacy in fact increasingly emphasized the importance of the bilateral relationship with the United States. The Koizumi cabinet, for example, actively supported American military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and dispatched SDF troops to both conflict zones in a surprising departure from Japan's longstanding policy of not deploying military forces overseas.<br />
</p>
<p>In the lecture, students will gain a clear perspective on Japanese diplomacy in the 21th century and be able to evaluate how Japanese diplomacy has genuinely contributed to stability and prosperity in Asia, and in East Asia in particular.</p>",Spring,404/405 (Bunkei Sougoukan 4F),,,,,Mon 10:30-12:00,2,1&amp;2,0,Courses

To better understand the interaction between theoretical and normative framework and practical problems, students will have to read and comment also on materials taken from actual cases.

<p>International commercial arbitration is becoming more and more important in the field of cross-border disputed resolution. While most advanced nations already are already familiar with arbitration, there is a growing demand of expertise in this field from recent developing countries. The regulatory framework in the world is moving towards a ""globalized"" arbitration: there is widespread acceptance of international models as base for legislation (e.g. the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration) and the circulation of awards is made smoother by effective international instruments (e.g. the 1958 New York Convention of the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards), However, many countries are lagging back in term of effective appliance of those international tools: national resistances (both legislative, judicial and political) and the lack of arbitration theoretical and practical expertise among legislators, judges and professional operators is jeopardizing an effective and homogeneous success of arbitration all over the world. One tool to subvert this situation is trying to provide law students with a strong basis of notions in this field. This seminar focuses on both theoretical and practical issues in arbitration, covering a wide spectrum of subjects in order to provide a comprehensive picture of what international arbitration is.</p>",Spring,Seminar Building 22,"Good command of English language (reading, speaking, and writing) is required.

First, a general overview of what an international moot competition is will be provided. Then, the seminar aims to provide students with the basic skills for preparing a dispute before an arbitration tribunal: analysis of the problem; research on the relevant legal issues; drafting a memorandum in arbitration (both form claimant and respondent sides), presenting the case orally. All those activities will be initially carried out under the supervision of the instructors in order to ensure that students are properly prepared. Then, as the seminar proceeds, a greater degree of autonomy and initiative will be expected. Students will be encouraged to develop their own critical views and defensive strategies on the Moot case. After the end of the seminar, students should have acquired a good knowledge of, inter alia, the Convention on the International Sale of Good, the general structure of administered arbitration and the basic tools for research and advocacy on a practical problem.","Due to the peculiar nature of the seminar, there is no need of a general textbook for students. Some relevant readings will be distributed to students on a regular basis, via the online syllabus system.",D Yokomizo,,"<p>Legal Education is presently facing challenges related to the internationalization of the legal profession. New, truly international, learning experiences are flourishing, and in particular extremely useful and challenging international commercial arbitration moots. One of the most prestigious is the Vis (East) Moot. As the organizers of this competition state, the Vis Moot was created as a clinical tool for training law students in crucial aspects of the procedure: research, drafting and advocacy. The goals of the Moot are the promotion and study of international commercial arbitration and the training of tomorrow's legal leaders in methods of alternate dispute resolution. </p>
<p>This seminar focuses on both theoretical and practical issues related to the Moot. This year (2014) case will be studied in detail. Starting from that, students will have to prepare the case (doing research and collecting materials), develop a defensive strategy and learn the basic skills of oral advocacy in arbitration. As the Moot case is based on the Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) the seminar will be an occasion for an in-depth study of this extremely useful international convention.</p>

This lecture substantially weighs on ""experience and involvement"" in many judicial spots and scenes in Japan. You will explore the inside and outside of Nagoya Keimusho(=jail), visit Nagoya District Court to meet and talk with a judge and a court secretary in a real court room, and call on Aichi Bengoshikai(=the bar association) to encoutner both new and estabilished practioners, as well as to have study aways to Osu and Toho Gas co., Ltd. Also, you will be highly expected to play an essential part in the moot criminal court, choosing either a judge, a prosecuter, a defense counsel, or witness, or make a presentation on your reserch from comparative approach. <br />
</p>
<p>It is not essential to have some background knowledge in Japanese judicial systems or Japanese laws. However, it is of paramount importance to be full of interest and passion for your study and to participate in class discussions and study aways, and just enjoy your explorations positively and spontaneously throughout this course. The class is conducted mainly in English. Also, if your guest speaker is not used to English, English translation is always followed. However, you are also expected to acquire and understand relevant Japanese legal terminologies. If you know some of these, your study through this lecture will always be more productive and fulfilling.</p>",,A Ogawa,,"<p>本講義は、日本についてほとんど知らないという状況のまま入学している本コース留学生に、日本社会、日本法についての概括的な情報を提供するために、弁護士の方と名大の教員が協力して、裁判所、検察庁、弁護士会、法務関連機関、企業等の訪問を軸に、日本の法制度の学習を行い、それらの総合学習を踏まえ、自国の制度と社会と比較し、自国の未来を展望するレポートを提出させるという、講義と実地見学を組み合わせた講義です。</p>
<p>講義では、資料の予習、実地見学前の概説、実地見学、見学に基づく質疑応答、自分の国の制度との比較を通じた自国の法と社会のより的確な理解を深めることを目標とています。日本社会と日本法を知るための実地見学を本講義ではかなり重視しています。講義の達成目標は、半年の講義で日本の社会と法制度の全体像について、一定の実感をもってもらうことです。　</p>
<p>It would appear that the overseas students entering the LL.M. in Comparative Law Program (English-taught program) arrive knowing very little about Japan. However, the curriculum of this course deals with advanced theories of law in each of its lecture series with a lack of explanations for those new to Japanese law and society.　Therefore, to give overseas students some general information regarding Japan, this course is run, in conjunction with the Aichi Prefectural Bar Association (International Special Committee) and the teaching staff of Nagoya University.</p>
<p>Lectures are given in conjunction with onsite visits (around half the time for each. Several lectures are taken). The lectures consist of the prior study of relevant materials, explanations before visits, question and answer sessions based on the visits, and the comparison of the system in Japan with one's own country so as to further one's understanding of the law and society of one's country. It is important that the onsite visits become the core part of the lectures so as to enhance one's knowledge of Japanese society and law.</p>
<p>Emerged in this varied learning experience, students make comparisons with their own countries' system and society, and submit reports on the future perspective they have for their country. Over the course of a half year of lectures, students will be given a vivid impression of the overall shape of Japanese society and the legal system.</p>",Fall,Integrated Research Building 408,good English skills,,,"Hirano, Tanabe, Ichihashi, Hayakawa",Thu 14:45 to 16:15,2,M1,0,Courses

<p>Joint Research Project : 50%</p>",,Introduction to Joint Research on Comparative Study of Law,Lecture,"<p>Students learn both how to analyze legal issues in a comparative perspective and to actually conduct a joint research.</p>
<p>➢        First, and from an epistemological point of view, they learn legal thinking without being stuck with one's own legal system: by dealing with different legal cultures and different non-national bodies of law, which overlap with the national law, they become increasingly aware of the range of possible legal responses to common issues and disputes. By adopting such world-view-of-law or multijural type of thinking, they have the possibility to actively construct their own legal understanding from various competing and overlapping sources and thus to contribute to a plural epistemology of law. </p>
<p>From a methodological point of view, they learn how to conduct a comparative study of law in a flexible way. Provided with a large methodological toolbox, they learn how to best approach different research questions using the most effective framework fitting to a comparativist's own interest of knowledge.</p>
<p>➢        Second, this workshop prepares students to be able to work collaboratively. It is based on the principle that they analyze and research together complex issues and discuss their findings; small-scale and team-work oriented, it aims at developing the know-how for managing group research through networking, material-gathering, planning techniques, concretizing research proposals and setting up research environments; it also helps to develop their argumentation techniques and communication skills.</p>","<p>A few manuals and handbooks are recommended and will be used alternatively.</p>

Edward Elgar Publishing, 2012.</p>",D Yokomizo,Yes,"<p>This workshop fully acknowledges the ever increasing need for comparison in a world in which pluralistic and transnational features are commonplace. In addressing the 'comparative study of law', it covers vast fields with different scholarly orientations and inner debates. However, rather than focusing on knowledge about comparative law as a separate academic field of legal science in the law curriculum, this workshop provides students with the opportunity to actually engage in comparative legal studies : first, they appreciate from a critical point of view the need to undertake the complex task of studying law comparatively ; second, they learn how to handle from a comparative perspective a wide range of transborders issues through various comparative research strategies, practices and techniques. Focusing more precisely on questions relating to Cross-border legal institution design, this workshop deals with the many processes involved in contemporary legal borrowings, and questions the pertinence from a practical perspective of concepts (including 'legal tansplants') generally used by comparatists to explain about the 'transfrontier mobility of the law'. </p>
<p>Based on the assumption that students learn law well when they are actively involved in a joint enterprise of constructing legal understanding from multiple sources, this workshop draws on complementary teaching approaches and combines lecture-style teaching, discussions with reading assignments before classes, concrete cases analysis and problem-solving. Students are called upon to research even in a more direct way: by actually engaging in comparative study of law and embarking progressively on their own joint research project. Skills oriented, this workshop conceives of comparative law as:</p>
<p>➢        A tool for students to have real world laboratory at their disposal - by looking across borders, they can investigate a wide array of legal solutions, approaches and concepts; assess these; be inspired by other legal systems or legal constructs; engage in a discussion about good or even 'best' pratices and solutions; possibly construct new legally relevant and perhaps competing meanings, and so forth; the international classroom setting, the very fact that this workshop is composed of students coming from various countries (and a variety of backgrounds and experiences), and that instructors themselves have been educated in different legal traditions, constitutes a strong incentive to this regard.</p>
<p>➢        A technique to train joint research in different legal traditions having distinct historical and methodological underpinnings - by looking together across borders, students can also cease to think in terms of a single national legal paradigm and prepare to cope with several jurisdictions ; in so doing, they become able to better understand and address the many ways law is crossing borders today. By stepping away from soloist type of comparativism and moving towards research-group based comparative study of law, they are also strongly encouraged to use multiple methods and several methodologies.</p>
<p>To begin with, this workshop explains about what comparative legal analysis is about today: some of its main features, contemporary uses, shortcomings, and protagonists; then, moving to a more detailed presentation, it introduces to a few ongoing debates and relevant topics, transforming areas and main tools of comparative legal studies (Session 1 and 2). Students become more familiar with both classical and new approaches to legal comparison, as well as with current and controversial issues in comparative legal studies.</p>
<p>Moving to the next stage, this workshop questions how such (scholarly defined) hypotheses and approaches to comparison are used in practice and even possibly tranformed in the actual conduct of projects that include a strong comparative dimension. Two illustrations are more particularly examined : first, 'legal assistance' projects (development aid in the legal field) conducted by national or international agencies in developing countries or countries in transition ; second, legal unification or harmonization projects ('integrative' projects) based on various approaches (Sessions 3 and 4). These sessions address concrete cases, focus on identified contexts, and draw on diversified materials. In so doing, they encourage students to engage more confidently in joint comparative legal research.</p>
<p>The following sessions (Sessions 4, 5 and 6) are more directly concerned with practical research management and are integrally conceived as training sessions. ""By walking one makes the road"": since a detailed method is something that cannot be fixed before an actual comparison takes place, students engage themselves in the process of studying law comparatively and work together on a legal topic determined by the instructors on a broad basis. Students are, in the same time, both provided with some basic guidance and given the largest margin of initiative to elaborate a joint research project by their own. What is at stake is some distinct experience of world-view-of-law in which there are several possibilities and one's own national law is seen - from the very beginning - as only one possible path to (legally) arrive at a solution. The final session (Session 7) is devoted to the public presentation by the students of their own joint research proposal.</p>",Fall,Leading satellite room,"<p>A good command of the English language (reading, speaking and writing) is required. </p>

<p>unarmed protesters in the eastern city of Andijan on May 13, 2005, following prison attacks by armed men.</p>
<p>Divergent views persist today with regard to this Andijan tragedy in the</p>
<p>context of human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>The position taken by the Uzbek government, supported by Russia, China and countries in Central Asia, places the blame on the terrorists. It claims that the armed group belonged to the terrorists group known as Akramia - a faction of the illegal Hizb-ut-Tahri (an Islam fundamentalist Party), which sought to establish an Islamic State refusing to accept human rights and democracy. They attacked the prison and used citizens as human shield while attempting to withdraw. That was how the gun battle started and they should be held responsible for the deaths. Uzbekistan has no choice but to respond to ""violence"" by the Islamic fundamentalists, who reject human rights and democracy, with equal ""violence"". The argument states that, for a premature secular state that had gained independence for merely 20 years, any response to ""violence"" by means of respects for human rights and democracy would lead to the demise of the State and therefore the ends of human rights and democracy. (Cry like a wolf when living with the wolf).</p>
<p>Against this first view, countries in the West and international human</p>
<p>rights NGOs come up with their critical arguments that human rights have</p>
<p>been violated in Uzbekistan under the pretext of fighting terrorism led by</p>
<p>the Islamic fundamentalists. Even a young independent State of 20 years old</p>
<p>has the duty to respect human rights and democracy. Notwithstanding the</p>
<p>future goal of human rights and democracy, ""violence"" in response to</p>
<p>""violence"" will create a vicious circle of violence and hatred. The future goal will never be achievable.</p>
<p>Six years after the Andijan tragedy, this criticism against Uzbekistan has not changed. For example, the Human Rights Watch includes the following</p>
<p>wordings in its 2012 World Report: Uzbekistan's human rights record remains appalling, with no meaningful improvements in 2011. Torture remains endemic in the criminal justice system. Authorities continue to target civil society activists, opposition members, and journalists, and to persecute religious believers who worship outside strict state controls.</p>
<p>What should be the appropriate way for Uzbekistan, a State in the process</p>
<p>of building and the front line of the war against terror, to develop its own goals of human rights and democracy? How should legal assistance proceed to promote the development of human rights and democracy in this country? This paper reviews some lessons learned from the JICA's experience of legal assistance (assistance in drafting the law on administrative procedure) in Uzbekistan and raises some issues which may be useful for the development of comparative studies in administrative law.</p>",Fall,Leading satellite room,None,,,,Fri 13:00-14:15,2,M2,0,Courses

Final report (50%).",,Asian Family Law,lecture,"<p>We will first take a general look at traditional Chinese family law and how it spread to surrounding areas including the Korean peninsula and Japan.  We will compare the differences between indigenous Japanese and Korean family law.  Though both received the influence of traditional Chinese family law their laws developed slightly differently due to variances in the cultures of each.  While both countries have modified their own legal systems using first Chinese and later ""modern"" systems from abroad this process did not constitute a total replacement of the older systems with newer, more advanced ones.</p>
<p>Secondly we will discuss issues related to South Asian family law, comparing India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and other surrounding countries.  Religions such as Hinduism and Islam have had a great influence on the Indian subcontinent and religious and customary laws are applied to family issues.  The general legal system that has been transplanted from European countries co-exists in these countries with personal laws and the choice of applicable law is often permitted in family matters.  The big issues to be discussed in these lectures will include whether the European influenced systems of general law should over-ride customary laws, whether family laws should be uniformed, and whether and how ""international standards"" on the protection of human rights should be introduced when they seem to conflict with personal laws.</p>",,Hiroko ITO,Yes,"The purpose of this course is to allow students to develop the skills needed to understand foreign legal systems and search for better ways of building appropriate legal systems for different communities using comparative techniques.  This series of lectures focuses mainly on East and South Asia.  Because ""Asia"" is a vast region with a multitude of cultural backgrounds we do not have a clear definition of the term ""Asian law"". Not many universities in the world provide courses on ""Asian law"" at either the undergraduate or graduate level. The term is often used to refer simply to Chinese law, even in Asia, or Indian law as it is in the United Kingdom.  In this course we use East Asia in order to understand contemporary Japanese law more clearly and South Asia in order to gain a better understanding of the reality surrounding the application of religious laws.  During the course of these lectures we will learn how to locate proper sources, a skill that is essential in finding the applicable law and solving conflict of law problems.  An example of this would be finding the conditions necessary for a valid marriage in the case of a mixed marriage.",Fall,Leading satellite room,"<p>A basic knowledge of Family Law and Private International Law are recommended.</p>

Specifically, the course is structured around an examination of each phase of the policy-making process, from the politics of agenda setting (emphasizing the role of the media and movements), policy formulation (including epistemic policy communities), policy decision-making and adoption (elitist, pluralist and technocratic models), implementation (bureaucratic politics), and policy evaluation and learning (technocratic versus constructivist and collaborative approaches). In the process, the course gives special attention to the kinds of knowledge and inquiry appropriate to each phase of the policy process.  Along the way, the role of theoretical models and the methods appropriate to the various theoretical orientations are examined, including the advocacy coalition model, rational choice theory, the liberal-institutional perspective, the  discourse approach, and the deliberative ""argumentative turn.""  The contemporary debates between quantitative and qualitative approaches to policy inquiry are also explored.",Fall,906,,,,,"November 19-30,2012",1,M1,0,Courses

It describes how the collapse of the Soviet Union along with the process of globalization entailed constitutional and legal reforms in Russia, which, inter alia, underline the significance of the international legal factor in the Russian law-making process and in its state bodies' and legal entities' everyday activity. The course examines theoretical conceptions and juridical mechanisms elaborated and used for these goals' achievement, especially the theories of transformation and implementation of international legal and political norms into the Russian legal system.</p>
<p>Practical part of the course contains detailed analysis of the most important problems arising during the process of international legal norms' implementation in the Russian legal system. Ways of solving of these problems were revealed basing on the decisions of Constitutional, Supreme and other courts of Russian Federation as well as on the activity of other state bodies and legal practice. Finally, the course outlines the use of international law by Russian officials and legal entities in order to establish and develop relations with their foreign partners and international organs and organizations, including UN and ECHR, and international institutes of Asia Pacific.</p>",Fall,906,,,,,"Jan.9-18, 2013",1,M1,0,Courses

I will give class evaluations and feedback after the class to round up the course.",2013-6-24,On-Demand Seminar,Seminar,"<p>By the end of the course, students will have a good appreciation of law, justice and development as separate concepts as well as taken together within the broader context of development in the 21st century. Students will also gain an understanding of the World Bank, its mandate, and development activities following that mandate. They will learn the intricacies of justice reform, how to plan a justice reform project and the different interests and considerations that come into play.</p>
<p>This course is certainly not an exhaustive treatment of the topics, but It is hoped that from this course, students will be inspired to engage in law, justice and development scholarship, and discover and explore interests and careers in the development field.</p>","In order to properly follow and fully benefit from class discussions, students are encouraged to read the assigned materials before each class. You are strongly encouraged to read all ""primary reading materials"" and if you have time, skim through the ""supplementary materials."" All reading materials will be made available to you before the class. Where necessary, I may provide references to other materials you may wish to study.",H Cisse,Yes,"<p>Focusing on the World Bank and its activities, this course studies the relationship between law, justice and development. Efforts to use law as a tool to promote development through a justice lens will be at the core of our discussions. In the last two decades especially, international organizations, states, aid agencies, academics, and local and international non-governmental organizations have become commendably active and committed to mainstreaming law and justice into the development agenda. </p>
<p>The conceptions of development that underlie national and international actions are diverse having among others, economic, social, and political dimensions. We will take an expansive view of law and justice, recognizing that in many contexts, they also border on political, cultural and socio-economic issues. Putting these into perspective, we will analyze how development practitioners have tried to devise innovative and creative ways to keep up with the changing and expanding needs of today's world and the different initiatives that back these efforts. </p>
<p>As an international financial institution with a development mandate, the World Bank has been involved in a great deal of these efforts—as an institution and, sometimes, in partnership with other institutions. We will take a critical look at some of the World Bank's development initiatives, especially in the area of justice reform. We will also look at case studies of a few projects, focusing on the policies and procedures of the Bank, the project cycle, and development approaches. In doing these, we will equally examine successes and failures, challenges faced and lessons learned, as well as current trends and prospects for the future for both the Bank and the development field in general. The course will round up with a practical exercise involving a justice reform project in a fragile state. Students will have the opportunity to consider the dynamics of justice reform and the interests and considerations underlying certain decisions and development efforts.</p>",Spring,Leading Satellite room,,,,,"June 24 to June 28, Mon 13:00-16:15,Tue13:00-16:15, Wed 9:00-12:15, Fri 15:00-16:30",1,M1,0,Courses

The transitions from authoritarian rule to democracy in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Sothern Asia and Africa have raised political and normative questions about how to address the abuses of former regimes and implant democracy and the rule of law. This course explores many of the challenges and improvements to the rule of law across  postotalitarian countries and their connection to democracy. I will try to explore these issues using the empirical examples from post-communist transformation in Central-Eastern European countries, particularly from Poland. This includes, above all, experiences from its successful political and legal transformation, which are extremely useful for rule of law promotion in developing countries.</p>
