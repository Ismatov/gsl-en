title: Renumerate: extract totals and grand totals from OCR text

This Python package provides document repair and analysis for
financial data embedded in OCR text.  Conservative heuristics are
applied at the string level, followed by a line analysis that tries
multiple assumptions against the text stream.  The results are
analyzed at document level, modelled as multiple assumptions covering
all possible combinations for unresolved ambiguities.  The top-level
class object `incomeStatement` returns a set of numbers with attached
metadata when a grand total is successfully identified, otherwise an
empty string.

Operations are broken into discrete classes for ease of
customization, and the code is supported by a reasonably thorough set
of unit and integration tests. Line analysis and penalty formulas for
choosing numeric clusters to discard during repeated attempts at
resolution are pluggable, for full customizability to suit local
requirements.

Version 1.7 incorporates a number of bug fixes that significantly
increase the rate of successful resolution.

Enjoy!
