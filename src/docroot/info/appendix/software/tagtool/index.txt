title: Tagtool: regular expression editing of XML

This module provides a rough and ready means of manipulating
XML-tagged text.  It may come in handy if you know exactly what you 
need to do to fix or transform a file, if only you could extract the
balanced tag spans from it to work on.

Enjoy.
