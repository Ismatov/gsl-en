This is a commercial service to which the GSL holds
a subscription.  It is an important source of primary legal
information, and should be treated as an extension of the
library collection.  A personal ID and password are required
to use the service.  For the details of how to apply, please

## Rules

Please comply with the following rules when using the
computer room:

1. Do not eat, drink or bring open food containers into the room.  This
   can be distracting to other users, and spills can damage the
   equipment.
2. Refrain from using cell phones in the room.  When entering the
   room, set your phone to manner mode or turn off its power.
   Ringing phones and conversations
   are a distraction to others.  If you need to 
   answer the phone, take the call outside of the room.
3. Restore manuals and other materials to their proper place
   after use. Donâ€™t remove materials or equipment from the room.
4. Students of other faculties may use the room if they
   need the facilities for their studies, but should do so
   in the normal way, by requesting a personal
   key card for full access.  Please direct such queries
   to Ms Tomizaki.
5. For your own security and for the security of the University
   network as a whole, Do not share your user ID and password 
   with other people.
6. To protect your personal information, be sure to fully log out
   from PCs or turn the power off cleanly when your session
   is finished.
7. The PCs in the room have been configured to protect personal
   information, to maximize stability, and to be convenient to
   most users.  Do not permanently 
   change settings that may affect other
   users.
8. About printing.  In the computer room, you will find
   a personal computer connected to the copy machine.
   The copy machine will also work as a printer;
   you can print files by connecting a USB memory to 
   the personal computer, 
   and printing in the normal way.
   A copy card, which can be purchased at the University
   Co-op, is required for printing. 
   The printing cost for one black-and-white page is
   10 yen, and one page printed in color costs 50 yen.
   For most print jobs, you may find it more economical
   to purchase a printer for use in your study room.

These rules are important to maximize the benefit of the
computer room for all students.  Those who do not comply
with them may be denied access to this facility.
