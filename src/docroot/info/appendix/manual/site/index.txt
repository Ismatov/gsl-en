title: Manual for GSL Site Editors

The GSL site is designed to make maintenance
convenient and risk-free.  We manage the site
using standard development tools from the software
industry, which have been carefully designed
and widely tested.  While it does require a little
study and preparation to begin editing work,
once learned, the system is exceptionally
straightforward and reliable.

Please refer to the individual chapters listed
to the right for illustrated guides on individual
operations.
Some specialized vocabulary is needed to
explain the system.  The main terms and concepts
are explained here for convenience and clarity:

Metadata
: *Metadata* is extra information *about* a document
that is attached to it in some way, outside of its
content.  For text documents on our
website, metadata includes the document title, 
the document nickname, and a flag showing whether 
the document should be shown with a table of contents.
This information is written at the very top of all
`*.txt` documents in the **Text archive**.

Markdown
: [*Markdown*][markdownEn] is a simple plain text
markup language that is used in all of the content
files.  The syntax is very simple, and a [Japanese
manual][markdownJa] is available.  The version of
Markdown used on our system has
a few extra features, which
are explained in separate manuals. See
the documentation of the [PHP Markdown Extra][phpmarkdown]
and [Maruku metadata Syntax][marukuextended] projects for details.

Repository
: See the entry for **Subversion**.

Rollout
: A *site rollout* is the final step in publishing
the website, when the changes committed to the 
Subversion repository from working copies are
exported as pages on the `gsl-nagoya-u.net`
webserver.

Server
: In this guide, "the server" refers to the remote
machine where our real site is stored.  The server
offers two services: Subversion and Apache.  Subversion
is a versioning database that keeps a record of all of
our content.  Apache is a webserver the serves the
finished website to the Internet.


Subversion
: The core of the maintenance system is the "Subversion
repository", or simply "the respository" for short.
Subversion is a database that preserves a record of
all changes made to the website contents and software,
with a note of who made each change.  The repository
cannot be edited directly; all editing is done on a
**Working copy** (also known as a **Checkout**)
of the website contents, and changes are added to
the repository with with a **Commit** command.
Under Windows, the software used to do Subversion
checkouts and commits is **Turtle SVN**.  Subversion
is free software.  The complete manual is available
online, both [in English][svnEn] and [in Japanese][svnJa].

Text archive
: This is the area of the **Working copy** that contains
the text (`*.txt`) files that make up most of the
pages of the website.  Inside the working copy, the
path is `src/docroot/info/`.  Since this is where
almost all of the editing work on the site happens,
it maybe convenient to put
a link to the `info` folder of your working copy
on your desktop.

TurtleSVN
: *TurtleSVN* is a program for sending and receiving
changes between a local **Working copy** of a Subversion
project and the Subversion repository.  There is no
fee for using Turtle SVN.
