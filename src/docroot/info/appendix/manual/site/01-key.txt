# The SSH Key
To access Subversion on the server, you
need to activate the security key.  This
is contained in a special file, which on
Windows systems displays a secret agent
logo like that shown in the illustration
to the right.  Click on this logo to activate
your key.

###### Step 2

# Entering a password
If your key is protected by a password (it
should be, for security purposes), a prompt
like that shown to the right will be displayed.
Enter your password and hit `Enter`, or click
on the `OK` button.  This will activate your
security key for all connections to Subversion
on the server.

It is convenient to activate your security key
in this way before beginning to work on the
website.
