# Commit from above your changes
It is possible to commit changes from the folders
where you make them, as you go along.  If you have
a lot of editing to do, however, this may be too
time-consuming.  In that case, you will want to
complete your editing work, and then commit all of
your changes at once.  Because TurtleSVN commits
only the files and folders that are *below* the
current location in the folder tree, it is best to
make the commit from the top-level folder of the
working copy, as shown in the illustration to the
right.

In the illustration, the red exclamation mark shows
that changes have been made somewhere in the tree
below, that need to be committed before they will be
accessible to other users and to the website.

# Select the commit menu item
A TurtleSVN commit operation is performed, like
everything else, by selecting the operation from the
right-click mouse menu.  The `Commit` option is
shown in the illustration to the right.

###### Step 2

# Commit memo
TurtleSVN will invite you to enter a note
concerning the changes.  You can leave this
blank if you like, but it can be useful
to have a short note of the purpose of changes,
for future reference.  This note can be in any
language, including Japanese.

###### Step 2

# Commit report
TurtleSVN will report the files and folders for
which it has sent changes to the repository.
If problems arise during the commit attempt,
the complaint will appear here.  The illustration
shows a commit in progress.  When it completes,
TurtleSVN will report the current version number 
in the repository, in the usual way.

# Icon update
You may need to [refresh the file browser](/en/appendix/manual/site/refresh.html)
to get the correct icon display, but after a successful
commit operation, the files and directories for
committing should show a green check-mark, as shown
to the right.
