# Editable pages folder
The editable pages of the site are located
below `src/docroot/info` in the
working copy folder.  The illustration to
the right shows a view of the `info`
folder.  It may be convenient to put a link
to this folder on your desktop, to save the
trouble of navigating to it.

The directories immediately below `info` are
fixed; if you add directories or files here,
they will not be visible on the website.
To work with the content, we must navigate
downward, into one of the subfolders.
In this example, we will navigate into the
`admissions` folder.

###### Step 3

# Admissions folder
The illustration to the right shows a view of
the `admissions` folder.  This corresponds to
the **Admissions** link in the navigation bar
of the website.  Note that the folder contains
three documents and one subfolder.  The
`index.txt` file corresponds to the page that
is diplayed when the user clicks on the 
**Admissions** link.  The other two files
correspond to the two file items in the **Folder
contents** for the folder page, and the subfolder
corresponds to the **Before you apply** folder link.

This same pattern is followed everywhere below `info`.
Every folder contains an `index.txt` file.
Other `*.txt` documents correspond to pages.
Subfolders correspond to folder links.  And so
on.

Editing site content is simply a matter of editing
the content of the `*.txt` files.  On Windows
computers, we will use Wordpad for this purpose.

# Editing with Wordpad
To open a file with Wordpad, hold the cursor over the file
and click on the right mouse button.  You can then select
Wordpad from the menu, as shown in the illustration to
the right.

# Editing a file
You can open the file and edit it in the normal way.
Inside the file, you will see one or more lines of
text, each beginning with a word and a colon.  This is
the *metadata header* for this page, and ends
at the first blank line.  The `title:` item is
required in every page.  Other items, such as the
`toc:` item shown in the illustration to the right,
are optional.  See the chapter on 
[Metadata fields](/en/appendix/manual/site/metadata.html) for more details 
on the fields that can
be entered in the metadata header.

# Make a change
In this example, we change the title of the
page from `Overview of programs` to `Programs
overview`.

# Save the file
After saving the file, notice the red exclamation
mark in the file icon.  This is a reminder that
it has been changed since the last update from the
Subversion server, and that the changes have not
yet been committed.  It is not
necessary to fix this immediately; if you have
a set of changes to make, can continue editing, and
commit your changes when you are finished.
