# Adding files to Subversion

You can add files and directories to your working
copy of the website in the normal way, just as you
would anywhere else.  However, to make your work
available to others for review, and to publish your
new pages on the website, you must tell your
working copy that these new files are to be managed
by Subversion.  Once you have performed the steps
shown here, the content of the files
will be sent to the Subversion server when you
commit your changes.

###### Step 2

# Select a folder
In this example, we will add a file to the `admissions`
folder.

###### Step 2

![](/en/materials/graphic/newfile02_menu_new.png)

# Create a new text file
All of the `*.txt` files for our website pages are
plain text files.  On a Windows computer, you can
create a plain text file from the right-click mouse
menu, as show in the illustration to the right.

###### Step 2

# Name the file
Give your new file a name.  To keep things simple
for our users, use all lowercase letters, and
*do not use spaces* in your filenames.  In this
example, we will add a page called `fees` to the
`admissions` folder.  The name
of the file should end in `.txt`, as shown in the
illustration to the right.

###### Step 2

# Add the file to Subversion
After the file has been created, tell the working
copy that it should be managed by Subversion, by
clicking on the right mouse button again, and
selecting the `Add` option in the menu, as shown
in the illustration.


###### Step 2

![](/en/materials/graphic/newfile05_add_file1_new.png)

# Confirm the addition
TurtleSVN will ask you to confirm additions to
Subversion.  In this example, we are adding only
our one file, `fees.txt`.  We do want to add
this file, so we click on the `OK` button.


###### Step 2

![](/en/materials/graphic/newfile06_add_file2_new.png)

# Additions reported
TurtleSVN will report on the files it has added
to Subversion.  If there are problems, it will
tell you about them.

###### Step 2

![](/en/materials/graphic/newfile07_added_file_new.png)

# File has been added
The icon of the file will change, to show that
it has been added to Subversion in your working
copy, but is not yet up-to-date in the
Subversion repository on the server.  Remember
that you may need to [refresh the file browser
display](/en/appendix/manual/site/refresh.html) before the icon will
show correctly.

###### Step

![](/en/materials/graphic/newfile08_edit_new.png)

# Edit as usual
The newly added file can be opened, edited and
saved in the normal way.  The illustration to
the left shows file content with a correct
`title:` header and Markdown markup.  This would
create a page in the website when it is previewed
or, after committing the change to the Subversion
server, rolled out to the Internet.
