# Website elements

It is common in Japan for hosting to be done
on a turnkey (丸投げ) basis, where one firm
takes care of site design, system software,
hosting, and domain name registration.  While
this is convenient in the beginning, turnkey
contracting makes the customer completely
dependent on the provider for the entire
service, and moving to a new provider can be
extremely expensive and difficult.

We therefore have divided the elements of
our Internet presence
into several separate contracts.  This gives
us much greater flexibility and freedom,
and the slight cost of needing a little background
knowledge of how Internet sites operate in order
to manage our contracts.  The key elements 
of our services are explained here.

Domain registration
: This is the registered name used for our website.
Our domain name is currently `gsl-nagoya-u.net`.
This registration must be renewed
from time to time; as of this writing, it is valid
through June of 2008, and the current **Registrar** is
[Melbourne IT][mit] in Australia.  Bennett currently
controls the settings of the domain name on the
Melbourne IT servers, and is responsible for
arranging for domain registration renewals.

Hosting service
: The *hosting service* is the company that
provides the Internet server behind our
domain name.  The hosting service is separate
from the domain name;
the hosting service machine has a numeric
address, and the **domain registration** and
**nameserver** connect the domain name to
this computer-friendly address.
Our server is currently hosted from Tokyo by
[まるごとサーバー][marugoto], a member of the GMO
group of companies.  The hosting contract needs
to be renewed once each year.

Nameserver
: The nameserver is the machine that tells
everyone on the Internet
what machine the domain name points to.
The nameserver is controlled by us through
the domain name registrar.  The nameservers
we currently use are maintained by [Starling
Software][starling], and are offered as part of our
general support contract with them.  It would be
possible to switch to a set of
nameservers inside the University, but for
this we would need to arrange for the necessary support
from University technical staff, which is not currently
available.

Registrar
: A *Registrar* is a company that submits registration
statements for domain names to the relevant Internet
authorities on behalf of customers like ourselves.
In Internet hosting contracts, the hosting service
almost always relies on a specialist firm to handle
the registration of the domain name.  It is a better
policy for the customer to deal directly with a 
qualified Registrar for the domain name registration,
to avoid being held captive.  This is our current
practice.

Support contract
: While the content of the website is (and should be)
our internal responsibility, the software used to manage 
any Internet site must also be managed and maintained.
This is specialized work, and costly to supply from
inside our Faculty.  Our website has been designed
and built by Starling Software, who also provide our
support contract.  If technical issues arise, the first
step should be to contact Starling staff for advice.
