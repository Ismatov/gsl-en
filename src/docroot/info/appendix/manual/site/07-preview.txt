# Preview before committing

After making a set of changes, it is a good
idea to preview them
before committing them to the Subversion
server.  You can do this with the following
steps.

###### Step 2

![](/en/materials/graphic/preview01_rubyinstallicon_new.png)

# Ruby Install icon
Find the Ruby `Install` icon in the top-level
folder of your working copy.


###### Step 2

![](/en/materials/graphic/preview02_rubyinterpretermenu_new.png)

# Run Ruby
With the mouse pointer over this icon, run
the Ruby interpreter, using the right-click mouse
menu as shown in the illustration to the right.

###### Step 2

![](/en/materials/graphic/preview03_rubysiterunning_new.png)

# Build the website
Ruby will build the website for you.  While
Ruby is running, it will show a black window
like that shown in the illustration to the
right.  It may take a minute or two for the
build process to complete; when it is done
and shows the message shown to the right,
you can preview the site using a web browser.

###### Step 2

![](/en/materials/graphic/preview04_sitepreviewtoppage_new.png)

# Start a browser
Start a web browser and enter the following into the
browser address field:

    http://localhost:8080/

The browser should display the top page of the site,
as shown in the illustration to the right.

###### Step 2

![](/en/materials/graphic/preview05_sitepreviewadmission_new.png)

# Explore your pages
You can navigate in the preview of the website
in the normal way.  In our examples, we have made
changes in the **Admissions** folder, so we 
navigate there to check that our changes came
through okay.

# That's it!
If the changes are satisfactory, you are now ready
to commit your changes to the Subversion server
as explained in the next section.
