# TortoiseSVN online help
Tortoise SVN comes with an online help system that
you can access from the right-click mouse button,
as shown in the illustration to the right.  Subversion
is a powerful version management tool, and there are
many features and functions that are not described
in this short guide.  Please visit the online help
system to explore how to handle versioning in more
depth.

In particular, *delete* and *rename* operations on
Subversion-aware files should be done through
the Subversion menu, rather than through the normal
Windows delete and rename commands.  You should
also commit any such changes before updating
your working copy, or they might be reversed
by the update.

Again, for more details, please see the much more
complete documentation under the `Help` menu item.
