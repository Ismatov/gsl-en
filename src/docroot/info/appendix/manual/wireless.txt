title: Connect to wireless LAN
css: manual.css

Wireless network connections are available in many
of the rooms around campus, including both the Law
building and the Integrated Research Building
where many classes are held.  To access the wireless
network, you must first create an account.  This
guide provides step-by-step instructions on how
to create an account and log onto the wireless
network.

If you are unable to connect to the network, and
you are uable to sort out the problem after talking
with your classmates, please feel free to ask for
help via the mail address at the bottom of this page.
We cannot promise to solve the problem for you, but
we may be able help get you pointed toward
a solution.

* **Preliminary notes**

  > Your computer needs to have a wireless network
  > device (either a builtin device, or an add-on
  > PCMCIA or USB card) to access wireless networks.
  > If you need a card, these are sold at most electronic stores
  > and at the University Co-op, but it is worth
  > first asking classmates whether they have a spare
  > card -- there should be many old cards floating
  > around campus.

  > These instructions assume the use
  > of the Windows XP operating system, and the 
  > illustrations are from the Japanese version of this OS.
  > If you use Windows XP with a different language
  > (such as English), some of the menu names will differ,
  > but the steps should be the same.

  > If you use a different operating system
  > (such as a Mac OS, Linux or Vista), some of the 
  > steps themselves will differ.
  
  > *If you would like to help extend

###### Step 0

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_000.png)

# Wireless network device
In Windows XP, begin by opening the network
connections menu.  Do this by clicking
on **Start** 「スタート」, then
the connections item 「接続」, then
the wireless network connections item 「ワイアレスネットワーク接続」,
as shown in the illustration to the right.
Windows XP computers sometimes have a slightly different
**Start** menu; you may need to click around a little
to find the wireless network device menu on your
computer.

###### Step 1

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_001.png)

# Display wireless networks
The wireless device menu is shown to the right.
In this menu, click on the button to show
wireless networks, 「ワイアレスネットワークの表示」,
circled in red in the illustration to the right.

###### Step 2

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_002.png)

# Request connection
Windows XP should display a window similar to
that shown to the right.  The University
wireless network routers will show up with
names beginning with **nuwnet**.  Choose a
**nuwnet** item with a strong signal (the strongest
signals are at the top of the list), and highlight
it by left-clicking on it with the mouse.  After
selecting a router, click on the connection button
「接続」to initiate the connection.

###### Step 3

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_003.png)

# Wait for connection
It may take a few seconds for your computer
to complete the connection.  While your
computer is attempting to establish a connection,
a window like that shown to the right will be displayed.
The window should disappear when the connection is
complete.

###### Step 4

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_004.png)

# Start a browser
When the connection has been established,
you can immediately log onto the network 
system if you have a network account.
If you do not yet have an account, you can
create one online right away.

In either case, the next step is to start up
a browser, as shown in the illustration to the
right.  (If you already have a browser running,
you may need to stop and restart it in order
to open the account creation/login menus.)

###### Step 5

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_005.png)

# Permit the connection
When your browser attempts to connect to the network,
it will find an unknown security certificate and
raise a security warning.  This is normal, for
the Nagoya University wireless network.
Accept the certificate and permit the connection
by clicking on the OK button　「はい(Y)」.

###### Step 6

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_006.png)

# Create your account
The login menu is shown to the right.
If you do not yet have a wireless network account,
you can create on by clicking on the 
registration link 「新規登録」, circled in
red in the illustration to the right.

###### Step 7

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_007.png)

# Accept terms and conditions
Before you can create a network account, you
must accept a set of terms and conditions,
which are all written in Japanese.  It is
not clear whether these would be binding
on someone who is unable to read them, but
in any case, you can proceed to create
an account by ticking the left-hand 
item 「承諾します」, and then clicking
on the button to proceed to the registration
form 「登録フォームへ」.


###### Step 8

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_008.png)

# Enter account details
In the registration form, shown to the right, enter
the required details, as follows:

1. **Wireless network ID** You can enter any personal ID that you
   like for your wireless network ID (so long as another user has
   not already claimed it).  Be sure to choose an ID that is easy
   for you to remember.
2. **University ID** This is the same 全学ID that you use to
   log onto University computers and the University mail
   system.
3. **University password** This is the password for the
   全学ID.
4. **Name** Enter your full name in the fourth field.
5. **Affiliation**  Click on the fifth field and select
   your faculty from the list.  For Law students, this will
   be the item containing the characters for law「法学」.
6. **Office** If you know the room number of your office,
   enter it here.
7. **Status** In the eighth field, select the appropriate item, 
    either student
   「学生」or academic staff 「教員」.
8. **Year of study** In the ninth field, enter your year of
   study as a student (academic staff can set any value
   here).
9. **Telephone** If you have a telephone, enter its number
   in the ninth field.
10. **Email**  You must enter an email address inside the
    `nagoya-u.ac.jp` domain in the tenth field.  The email
    address connected to your University ID will work
    for this purpose.

After filling out the form, click on the registration
button 「登録」.


###### Step 9

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_009.png)

# Enter ID and password
After your account is registered, you will
be returned to the login form.  Enter the
ID that you chose, and for the password
enter the email address that you entered
in item 10 of the registration form.

###### Step 10

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_010.png)

# Accept connection (again)
Windows XP will again find the unknown
security certificate, and raise a security
warning.  Accept the certificate again
by clicking on the OK button 「はい(Y)」.


###### Step 11

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_011.png)

# Wait for login
The system should display a screen similar to that
shown to the right.  If you are impatient, you
can click on the `click here` link.


###### Step 12

![](/en/materials/graphic/wl_012.png)

# Click to the Internet!
If you reach a screen like that shown to the right,
your login was successful (hurray).  Your computer
should now have a full connection to the Internet.
You can click on the "from here" link 「ここから」to open the
page your browser was originally attempting to access when
the login process was triggered.
