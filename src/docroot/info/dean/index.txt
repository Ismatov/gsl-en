The Nagoya University School of Law started out as the Nagoya University Law and Economics Department and Political Science Department in 1948, shortly after the end of World War II. In 1950 the Law Department and Economics Department were split up and made independent of each other, after which the graduate school was established in 1953. The School, at first, used to occupy an old wooden barracks, within the confines of the air-raid damaged Nagoya Castle, which had belonged to the No. 6 Infantry Regiment of the former Imperial Army. In 1959 it was moved to its present day location at Higashiyama Campus. 

The Law Department and Law Graduate School where thus established anew, seeking to build a peaceful nation of sophisticated culture out of the ruins of a lost war. The School and Department emerged through the efforts of staff and students, initially making do with meager facilities and low staff numbers. The bad conventions and conservativism that had hijacked our old and better traditions were jettisoned, and a free and open academic ethos unshackled by authoritarianism took shape.  

In the 60 years since then, the Law Department and Graduate School have come to hold a prominent position in the Chubu region as one component of a major Japanese university. They offer to society much excellent research, and have helped spawn a great number of talented people. The Department and Graduate School have needed to adapt to the changing times and society, and have engaged in various organizational changes and expansions, as well as improvements and enhancements to the research and teaching system. 

We have been particularly active in exchanges with overseas universities and research institutes. Whereas law and political studies in Japan has traditionally been very much connected to the West, the Nagoya University Law School and Faculty from early on has focused on Asian law and politics. At the start of the 1990s we began to approach such Asian-centered research and education in a more systematic manner. We have now reached the stage where we hold the core position in Japan in this area. I believe that we will continue to enjoy, as we have always sought to do, the fruits of our open-minded ethos and progressive spirit born from a freedom that shirks established authority and which continues to this day.

Presently, the Department and Graduate School have concluded academic exchange agreements with forty-seven overseas universities and research institutes. Large numbers of overseas students study alongside Japanese students enlivening our campus. The Nagoya University Law Department and Graduate School of Law will do its utmost to ensure that our students, with their great dreams and drive, can enjoy student life to the full, and conquer whatever goals it is they strive for.
