Overview

The Transnational Doctoral Program for Leading Professionals in Asian
Countries is a distance education initiative, built upon the Nagoya
Law Faculty's fifteen-year experience with human resource development
in support of legal and judicial reform in Asian countries. The program
is open to applications from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Mongolia for the
academic year beginning in 2014.

The program is tailored to the needs of officials in the legislative,
administrative and judicial sectors, as well as university faculty in
the fields of law and political science, who hold an LL.M. degree from
a foreign institution, and are unable to pursue resident study toward
the LL.D. degree. Admitted candidates will carry out their research
and dissertation work in their home countries, while continuing to
fulfill their official duties.

Technical assistance will be provided to each admitted candidate
through the Nagoya University Asian Satellite Campus Office (the
Onsite Operation Office) in the country where the candidate resides
and works. Regular guidance on academic writing, research methodology
and occasional special lectures will be organized by the Onsite
Operation Office to support the candidateâ€™s research efforts. Academic
supervision will be provided by a member of staff in Japan, in
cooperation with an associate supervisor to be nominated by Nagoya
University from among local scholars in the same field of research.
Each year for three years following admission, candidates will be
required to arrange for a supervision and research visit to Japan of
one to three weeks.

Upon completion of coursework, submission of dissertation, and
successful oral defense, this program leads to the Nagoya University
degree of LL.D. in Comparative Law.
