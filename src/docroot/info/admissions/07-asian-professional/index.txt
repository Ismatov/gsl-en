Countries

**Overview**
The Graduate School of Law, in collaboration with the Asian Satellite Campuses
Institute is offering a special research-based doctoral program which primarily
targets professionals in government positions, not-for-profit groups, 
professional societies, and academic institutions from select Asian countries
who have already completed a masterâ€™s degree and wish to earn a doctoral degree.
The program is unique in that it provides enrolled students an opportunity to
deepen their knowledge and experience and work towards a doctoral degree without
having to suspend their career to undertake higher degree studies. 

Upon completion of coursework, submission of dissertation, and
successful oral defense, this program leads to the Nagoya University
