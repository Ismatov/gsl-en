# University Admissions in Japan

Admission to Japanese university programs is
ordinarily by written examination, administered either once or twice
each year depending on the program, *in Japan*, *at the target
university*.  An interview may also
be required, depending on the regulations of the program and of the
university concerned.  This admissions process is tailored to Japanese
residents schooled within the Japanese education system, the core
curriculum of which has a degree of national uniformity at both the
secondary and undergraduate levels.  It is not appropriate to most
overseas applicants.

Overseas admissions are treated specially, in connection with certain
scholarship programs or exchange agreements.  The relevant paths for
admission to programs within the School of Law are outlined below.

# Postgraduate Comparative Law Program

## Country-based integrated scholarship (JDS)

The JDS scholarship for participating Master's programs is coordinated
by the [Japan International Cooperation Center (JICE)][jice], and is
open to candidates from selected jurisdictions. The Nagoya University
Graduate School of Law accepts candidates under this program from the
following jurisdictions:

[jice]: /en/support/index.html#japan_international_cooperation_center_jice


* Cambodia
* Mongolia
* Myanmar
* Uzbekistan
* Vietnam

The selection of JDS fellows is a joint project of the government of
the target jurisdiction, the academic staff of the receiving Japanese
university, and JICE itself. Successful applicants to the JDS program
who specify "Law" at "Nagoya University" as a Desired Study Course
must successfully complete the application process for the [LL.M.
(Comparative Law) for April entry][llm-cl].  An expedited application
review is the basis for admission. The program in this instance is two
and a half years in length.

## Exchange-based integrated scholarship (Special Program)

The Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
Technology has set aside a limited number of Japanese Government
(Mongukagakusho) Scholarships for use by universities participating in
an initiative entitled *Government-sponsored Special Programs for the
Preferential Placement of Foreign Students (Foreign Students for
Research)*.  The Nagoya University Graduate School of Law has obtained
approval under this scheme for its *Human Resources Development 
Program to Contribute to Asian Technical Legal Assistance Projects*.
To save space, we will refer to this initiative here as "the Special
Program".

Under the Special Program, certain academic institutions that are
party to academic exchange agreements with the GSL or the University
may recommend candidates for admission to the [LL.M. (Comparative Law)
for October entry][llm-cl-oct] or the [LL.D. (Comparative Law)][lld-cl]
programs.  The relevant institutions are the following:

[llm-cl-oct]: /en/admissions/llm-applications#englishtaught_octoberentry


* [Royal University of Law and Economics, Phnom Penh][rule]
* [School of Law, National University of Laos][nuol]
* [School of Law, Mongolian National University][mnu] (page in Mongolian)
* [School of Law, Samarkand State University][ssu]
* [Tashkent State Institute of Law][tsil]
* [University of World Economy and Diplomacy, Tashkent][uwed] *(site may time out)*{: style='color:red'}
* [Hanoi Law University][hlu] *(site may be down)*{: style='color:red'}
* [Ho Chi Minh City University of Law][hcmcul]

Selection is based on the submitted application materials, together
with an interview in the candidate's country, where feasible.  The
number of places for this category of preferred admission is
coextensive with the number of scholarships available.  Successful
applicants are not required to sit a separate entrance examination.
The program in this instance is two years in length.

## Embassy recommendation (postgraduate)

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) administers a scholarship
screening process each year between March and May (a [list of
embassies and consulates general][mofa] is available).  Successful
applicants are *recommended* to the Japan Ministry of Education,
Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) for the award of a
Japanese Government (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship. This recommendation
does *not* guarantee a place in an academic program in Japan;
recommendees must separately secure admission on the basis of the
study program laid out in their scholarship application.  Admission
requires both the consent of a supervising professor, and formal
admission by the University concerned.

[mofa]: /en/support/index.html#japan_ministry_of_foreign_affairs_mofa

Because the notification of results is often made during summer break,
when academic staff are either on holiday or immersed in research
work, it is generally difficult to secure the agreement of a
supervising professor without significant advance groundwork.  We
strongly urge candidates who believe they may be successful in the
Embassy Recommendation screening process, and who hope to apply to the
Graduate School of Law, to carefully study the research profiles of
our faculty, and to make preliminary contact before the announcement
of results, where possible. *Leaving this step to the last minute may
result in disappointment.*

In the Nagoya University Graduate School of Law, candidates entering
with Embassy Recommendation are initially admitted as Research
Students, and must pass an entrance examination, in principle within
one year of arrival, in order to enter the LL.M. (Comparative Law)
program.

## Other scholarships (postgraduate)

Postgraduate applicants other than
JDS and Special Program scholars are subject to the same
conditions as Embassy Recommendation candidates,
entering as Research Students upon arrival in Japan,
with admission to a degree program being subject to 
passing the relevant entrance examination.

For information on other scholarships, 
see the website of the [Japan Student Services Organization
(JASSO)][jasso].

# Undergraduate Program

## Embassy recommendation (undergraduate)

The Embassy Recommendation screening process [described
above][embassy-recommendation] is also open to undergraduate
applicants.  The conditions of admission to the School of Law
are similar, requiring that applicants pass the relevant
entrance examination administered at Nagoya University,
after arrival in Japan.  However, undergraduate students
spend the initial year of non-degree study at the Tokyo 
or the Osaka University of Foreign Studies for an intensive 
period of language training.

[embassy-recommendation]: #embassy_recommendation_postgraduate

## Other scholarships (undergraduate)

Unfortunately, there is no provision for waiver of the
entrance examination requirement for overseas applicants
to the undergraduate program.  The Japan Student
Services Organization (JASSO) does administer an [Examination for
Japanese University Admission for International Students
(the EJU)][jasso], at a number of overseas examination sites.
This examination is 
recognized by some Japanese university programs as grounds 
for direct admission, without a separate entrance examination,
in advance of arrival in Japan.  While international
applicants to the Nagoya University School of Law
are required to sit this examination, it is
not by itself sufficient for admission.  In practice,
therefore, the Embassy Recommendation process
described above is the sole path of admission for
foreign applicants to the undergraduate program.
