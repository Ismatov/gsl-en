title: Writing aids

When writing, it can be useful to see how a word or phrase
has been used by other authors. The tools on this page provide
"context glossaries" for that purpose.

Springer Exemplar
: This online service shows the context of a given word
or phrase as it appears in articles published by Springer journals.

Adelaide Text Analysis Tool (AdTAT)
: AdTAT is a personalised writing tool created to help international
researchers writing in English. Each user builds their own ‘corpus’
from about 20 scholarly articles directly relevant to their thesis
topic. The user can then do tailored ‘keyword in context’ searches of
their corpus to quickly learn how to use the English words and phrases
they need to use in their thesis.
