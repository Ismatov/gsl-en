# More on adding items to MLZ

It needs to be emphasised that MLZ import is only as good as the
metadata an online source provides.

-   You should [check
    metadata](http://www.zotero.org/support/getting_stuff_into_your_library#verify_and_edit_your_records)
    after adding new items, especially if not familiar with the source.
-   Often some editing or tidying up will be needed.
-   Occasionally the results might not be what you expect at all…

## Multiple import

Many catalogues and search engines (not all) will show a **folder** icon in search
results pages which enables you to import multiple items from the
results list.

**Example:** [Google Scholar (Legal documents)](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=escola&btnG=&as_sdt=2%2C5)

![image](/en/image/addmulti.png){: class='clear'}

This is convenient for rapidly adding a lot of references for subsequent
weeding and editing (eg, when exploring sources for a new or proposed
research project).

## Examples of legal catalogues that work well

-   [British and Irish Legal Information Institute (court judgments)](http://www.bailii.org/)
-   [Google Scholar (Legal documents)](http://scholar.google.com)
-   [Lao PDR, National Assembly (legislation)](http://www.na.gov.la/)
-   [Mongolia (laws, regulations and local ordinances)](http://www.legalinfo.mn/)
-   [Uzbekistan (decrees and legislation)](http://lex.uz)
-   [United States, Google Scholar (court judgments)](http://scholar.google.com/)
-   [United States, Cornell LII (US Code)](http://www.law.cornell.edu)
-   [Japan, Supreme Court (in Japanese)](http://courts.go.jp)
-   [Japan, Diet Committees (in Japanese)](http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/)
-   [Japan, Law Reform Council (in Japanese)](http://www.moj.go.jp/shingi_index.html)

**Example:** [Grace v. MacArthur, 170 F. Supp. 442 (E.D. Ark., 1959).](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=grace+v.+macarthur&hl=en&as_sdt=2,5&case=15978622162155990004&scilh=0)

(click on **scales** icon to add to MLZ)

![image](/en/image/estc.png){: class='clear'}

This is pretty good - it’s got the right item type, jurisdiction, court name, reporter, volume, date of decision, and URL.

**Improvements?**

-   Add Related link(s) to parallel reporter(s)?
-   Docket number, if known?
-   Add short title

A caveat about legal resources: when the layout or format of a website
changes, the MLZ translator may break. If you have problems downloading
items, please report the problem so that it can be fixed.

## Examples of problematic legal catalogues

After import, metadata from some sources will need some (or a lot of) editing:

-   [WTO legal texts](http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/legal_e.htm)
-   [UN Documents](http://www.un.org/en/documents/index.shtml)

**Example:** [UN Charter](http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/)

![image](/en/image/mlz-un-charter.png){: class='clear'}

Errmmm… where to start?!

If the MLZ importer does not "know" a site, it will be treated as a
*Web page* item. That is what has happened here, and the item
must be fixed manually with complete and correct metadata.

For this particular example, the item type should be changed to
*Statute*, the date should be set in the *Date Enacted* field, and the
*Jurisdiction* should be set to "United Nations". The corrected
item will look like this:

![image](/en/image/mlz-un-charter-fixed.png){: class='clear'}



## Manually Adding Items

What to do when you only have a printed document or a PDF files? In that case
you will need to create an item yourself and enter the details manually.

**Example:** [Martha Olcott, "Regional Study on Human Development and Human Rights: Central Asia" (UNDP)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2000/papers/martha%20olcott.pdf)

![image](/en/image/zotbuttadd.png){: class='clear'}

Click on the **green plus** icon.

The example item is a report, so choose the *Report* type. Enter the
UNDP as the *Institution* (not the author!), and fill out the other
fields with as much information as you can. For documents collected
from the Web, be sure to enter their address in the URL field.

After creating the item, you can attach the PDF itself to the item
(see below).

--------

# Adding Attachments

You can attach links, a snapshot of a webpage, files from your computer
or from the web, etc, to items. You can add as many different ‘child’
notes and attachments to any MLZ item as you like.

(You can also save notes and items directly to MLZ without needing to
attach them to anything, but they’ll have more limited metadata and
options. We recommend creating *some* sort of parent item for
objects if possible.)

**Example:** [Martha Olcott, "Regional Study on Human Development and Human Rights: Central Asia" (UNDP)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2000/papers/martha%20olcott.pdf) (the same example as above, saved to your Desktop)

The item we have created manually (in the previous section) does not
yet have a copy of the text of the report itself. Attaching a copy
to the item will allow us to search it, and to call up the report
when we are offline. 

![image](/en/image/mlz-attachment-menu.jpg){: class='clear'}

Select **Attach Stored Copy of File...** from the menu, find the document you want to 
attach, and click **OK** (or **Open** or whatever).

**Things to know:**

-   You can rename the attachment by right-clicking on the item and
    selecting **Rename File from Parent Metadata** from the menu.
-   You can also rename the attachment by clicking in its title.
-   After using **Attach Stored Copy of File...**, you can remove the
    document from your desktop: the full copy is now stored in MLZ.
-   To get a copy of the document (to send as an email attachment, etc.),
    right-click on the attachment and select **Show File**.

**See:**

-   [Adding Files to Your Library](http://www.zotero.org/support/attaching_files)

--------

# Annotating

Notes are another kind of attachment: click on the **Notes** tab, then the
**Add** button. You can quickly type or paste in rich-text notes,
transcripts, summaries -- any kind of annotation that seems useful.

**See:**

-   [Notes](http://www.zotero.org/support/notes)

--------

# Organising Items

You can use collections, tags and relationships to organise and link
items.

## Collections and sub-collections

"My Library" is a big bucket containing *all items* that you capture
for personal use.  The *collections* underneath it (folder icons) are
bundles of items from the parent library.

An item can be put into multiple collections. A change to the item
anywhere -- in the parent library or in any collection where it
appears -- takes effect everywhere (i.e. in the parent library, and in
all collections).

**Example:** Create a Collection titled "Human Rights", and sub-collections
"Human Trafficking" and "Refugees".

![image](/en/image/mlz-mycoll.png){: class='clear'}

To add the top-level collection click, on the "New Library" button (top,
furthest left) or right-click on **My Library** for a menu.

To add the sub-collections **right click** on the parent collection ("Human Rights") and
select "New Subcollection".

To add an item or items to a collection, just select them in the centre panel, drag, and drop.

If you want to remove an item from a collection, right-click on it and
select "Remove from Collection". (This does not delete the item from
"My Library"; to do that, select "Move to Trash" instead.)

To remove a collection from the panel tree, right-click on the collection.
The menu option **Delete Collection** will remove only the collection (and its
children). It will *not* remove the items it contains: they will still exist
in "My Library", and in any other collections where it appears.

To remove a collection *and* the items it contains, select **Delete Collection and Items...**
from the right-click menu. This will remove the collection an put the items into the "Trash"
folder. Be careful with this option -- it may delete items that you want to keep on file in
"My Library"!


## Tags
{: class='clear'}

![image](/en/image/mlz-tags-pane.png)

In item view, go to the Tags tab.

-   click on the **Add** button to add a new tag and type whatever you
    want.
-   Hit Enter to complete the tag and start a new one.
-   Click on existing tags to edit them
-   Delete tags using the **minus** button to the right of each tag.

Note that items captured from the Web may include automatic tags.
If any tags shown in the list do not seem useful, you can delete them.

## Tag Selector
{: class='clear'}

This is located at the bottom of the Collections section on the left
hand side of the MLZ pane. If you can’t see it, use *Ctrl-Shift-T* to bring
it up (*Cmd-Shift-T* in Mac OSX).

You can drag and drop single or multiple items into tags shown in the Tag
Selector, and you can also edit and delete tag names here (using right-click).

**Try these steps:**

-   Add several items to the "Human Rights" collection.
-   Select one item in the collection, and as described above, open its **Tags** tab in the right panel.
-   Click on the **Add** button, enter "Human rights" as the tag name, and press the
    Enter key.
-   Open the Tag Selector (if it's not already showing).
-   Select all items in the "Human Rights" collection, drag them to the "Human rights"
    tag, and release the mouse button to drop them.
-   Click on the items in the centre pane to check that the "Human rights" tag
    has been added to all of them.
-   Click on "My Library".
-   Click on the "Human rights" tag to show only the tagged items.

## Collections vs tags

Collections and tags do something similar: each shows a subset of the
items in the "My Library" bucket. There are some differences:

-   Collections are hierarchical: you can create sub-folders, but you
    can't create sub-tags.
-   Multiple tag selections are cumulative: you can select
    multiple tags to narrow a selection: you can't select multiple
    collections.
-   Tags are portable: when you drag an item to a separate group library (we'll
    learn about groups in the next lesson), its tags are copied with
    it: collections are not copied between libraries.

**Which to use?**

Each researcher has their own working style. Here is how I use
collections and folders in my own work:

-   I create collections for particular projects, such as my CV,
    or a specific research project I am working on.
-   I add several short tags to *every item* in "My Library". The tags allow me
    to fetch all of the items related to a certain subject by choosing
    the tags that describe it, such as "Civil Code" and "Japan".

**See:** [Collections and Tags](http://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags)

## Relationships: another option

You can also link items by creating a *relationship* between them,
using the **Related** tab. I use this only to link the chapters of
a book, or parallel reports of the same court judgment.

# Importing and Exporting Data

## Import

If you already have a library built using another tool (such as EndNote), 
you can move it to MLZ by importing it. MLZ recognises several import
formats.

**See:**

-   [Importing from other tools](http://www.zotero.org/support/getting_stuff_into_your_library#importing_from_other_tools)

## Export

Similarly, you can export libraries in various structured data
formats (including BibTex, XML). You can also produce formatted bibliographies
directly from items in your MLZ library.

To export, right-click on the collection or selection of items you want to export,
and choose the **Export Collection** or **Export Items** option. You will
see a dialogue to choose your required data format and any available
options for that format (e.g. whether to export notes or files with the
references) before downloading.

![image](/en/image/exportdata.jpg){: class='clear'}

**See:**

-   [Exporting from MLZ](http://ica.library.oregonstate.edu/tutorials/lesson/631--Advanced-Zotero?mid=26241&type=MiscellaneousResource&uid=1271)
-   [Import/Export support forum](http://forums.zotero.org/4/)

## Exporting from Libraries at zotero.org

You can also export single or multiple items from personal or group
libraries on the website:

![image](/en/image/export1.jpg){: class='clear'}

Click on the export button and a dialogue will come up allowing you to
choose a format to download. You will then be able to import this
reference into your MLZ library or another reference manager or tool.
(As far as I know, it does not export attachments; you’d need to upload
those separately.)
