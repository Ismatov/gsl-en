# Installation

There are three steps to installing a working Multilingual Zotero system:

- Install the [Multilingual Zotero](http://citationstylist.org/tools) client;
- Install the [Abbreviation Filter](http://citationstylist.org/tools/#abbreviation-filter);
- Install the appropriate [word processor plugin](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_installation) from the Zotero website.

# First Reference

![image](/image/nulsearch.png)

**Go to:** [Nagoya University Library OPAC](http://opac.nul.nagoya-u.ac.jp/webopac/locale.do?language=ja&page=/ctlsrh.do?gcattp_flag=all&gcattp=&arg5=@5&fromDsp=catsrk&initFlg=_RESULT_SET&words=homage%20to%20catalonia)

Click through to one of the books listed in the search.

You should see a small blue icon in the address bar.

![Address bar icon](/image/browser-address-icon.png){: class='clear'}

Just
click on it…

**See:**

# The MLZ Client

To find your saved reference you need to open up the MLZ client in
the browser.

## Accessing the MLZ pane

Alternatives:

-   browser *Tools* menu
-   *Multilingual "Zotero"* icon in toolbar
-   keyboard shortcuts: *Ctrl-Shift-Z* on Windows/Linux or *Shift-Command-Z*
    on Mac OS X

**Note:** There are often (at least) two different ways of doing the
same thing in MLZ. When you have an item(s) selected, try
right-clicking on it for a menu of options.  Many actions can also be
performed via the top-row buttons (or the gear button).  There are
also keyboard shortcuts for some actions (check out the Shortcuts tab in
Preferences). Click around and explore!

![image](/image/mlz-pane.png){: class='clear'}

The buttons along the top row give access to a number of key functions
including:

-   new collection/group
-   access to preferences and export functions
-   add new item/note/attachment
-   search

The three sections from left to right show increasing detail, from the
broad overview of collections to individual item metadata.

-   **Right (from the top):** My Library; Group libraries I belong to; Tag selector
-   **Centre:** List of items in selected library/collection. *Icons* denote
    item type, an *arrow* (triangle) indicates there are attachments
-   **Left:** Item metadata tab views (Info, Notes, Tags, Related)

------

# Centre Panel

![Centre Panel](/image/mlz-pane-centre.png){: class='clear'}

In the centre panel of the MLZ pane, you can sort by different
columns and choose which elements to show.

------

# The Item Info tab

![Info Panel](/image/mlz-reference-info.png){: class='clear'}

-   Some fields are available for all item types (eg:
    Title, Author, Date, URL)
-   Other fields appear only on particular item types.
-   Most are free text fields, but *Item Type* and
    *Jurisdiction* can be entered only from a controlled list.


## Important fields

*Item Type*
: Click on this to see the list of all the available types. If
changing the *Item Type* will cause a loss of data in existing
fields you will get a warning message

*Title*
: Most items have a title. (Exceptions include Japanese court judgments
and isolated provisions of codified US statutes.)

*Author*
: On this field you can: (1) change the creator type if others are
available; (2) add more creators with the + button or Shift+Enter; (3)
change between single-field and two-field mode.

*Date*
: MLZ does its best to auto-detect date formats

*URL*
: When a URL is entered in this field, clicking on the label will open the
webpage

The Web Page item type is one of the simplest: you can explore
the others by changing the setting in the *Item Type* field.

The limits on item types and fields within them are among the few
absolute constraints in Zotero and MLZ: you cannot have custom item types or
custom fields within item types.

------

# Preferences

![Gear button](/image/mlz-gear-menu-context.png){: class='clear'}

Click on the gear icon and select **Preferences**.

There are a lot of available options (most of which you’ll probably
never change!). The ones most likely to interest you are:

*General*
: Adjust appearance and set a number of useful features.

*Sync*
: Set your zotero user account details to enable syncing functions

*Search
: Turn full-text indexing of PDFs on and off (you might want this on)

*Export*
: Specify how bibliographies and data exports are generated, and
drag-and-drop behaviour

*Cite*
: Install word processor plugins, add and remove citation styles

**See:**

-   [Preferences](http://www.zotero.org/support/preferences)

## General preferences

![Preferences dialog](/image/mlz-preferences-dialog.png){: class='clear'}

Noteworthy settings:

*Automatically snapshots for webpage items*
: This can be useful for searching and to ensure you have an archived copy of the page

*Automatically attach associated PDFs when saving items*
: If this is checked MLZ will attempt to download and attach PDFs,
for example when saving from Google Scholar or an online journal.

*Automatically tag items with keywords and subject headings*
: Some catalogues and websites will add a *lot* of keywords that
aren’t necessarily relevant to your interests, so your mileage may
vary with this one!

*Data to be copied with items*
: Select whether tags, notes and attachments are also copied when copying items
between libraries

## Sync preferences

![image](/image/syncingprefs.jpg){: class='clear'}

If you want ML to sync with a [zotero.org](http://zotero.org) account and across multiple
devices you will need to fill in your account details here.

You have the options to sync attached files as well as bibliographical
information: bear in mind that if you turn this on it can eat into your
storage allowance very quickly!

Your basic bibliographical references *aren’t* included in storage
allowance limits though - syncing those is unlimited. And if you run out
of storage space, MLZ doesn’t delete anything - it just stops syncing
attachments beyond that point.

# Zotero website

-   **[http://www.zotero.org](http://zotero.org/)**

It’s quite possible to use MLZ effectively without a [zotero.org](http://zotero.org)
account. But you won’t be able to use the file storage, syncing and
group collaboration without one.

## Registration

[Registration form](http://www.zotero.org/user/register/)

![Registration page](/image/zotreg.jpg){: class='clear'}

## After registering

-   Explore your profile and account settings - including privacy
    settings, storage, email, etc
-   Take a look at the [documentation and support
    forums](http://www.zotero.org/support/).
-   Keep a copy of [Citations, Out of the Box](http://citationstylist.org/public/mlzbook.pdf) close by.

You can do many things interchangeably between the website and your
MLZ client, so long as you have automatic syncing turned on (see the
note below about where your stuff is).

You can choose whether to make your library private (this is the
default on registering) or public.

**Note:** accounts can be deleted from within the user account settings.

## Searching

On most pages on [zotero.org](http://zotero.org) there is a quick search bar in the
navigation menu, which changes according to context between ‘people’,
‘groups’ and ‘support’. (In the search results you get the option to
change to a different type of search if you want to.)

When viewing a library, you can use the search bar to search that
library.

# Where is your stuff?

The MLZ client is installed directly on your computer, and saves
references locally, on your computer. If you don’t turn on syncing,
that’s where it stays.

When you turn on automatic syncing, your references are all copied to
Zotero’s storage servers in the cloud. You will be able to access them,
make changes, add more, delete and so on in your personal library at
[zotero.org](http://zotero.org), and any changes you make there will sync back (within a few
minutes, usually) to your local installation.

You can then install the MLZ client on other computers, put in your
account details and turn on syncing, and it will mirror your stuff
across all those computers.

Syncing can’t necessarily be relied on as a perfect, complete backup of
everything in your library (for example, as already noted, if it runs
out of storage space it will stop syncing attachments). The safest way
to ensure you get a backup of everything in your MLZ installation
(including things like plugins, customisations, additional citation
styles, and so on, as well as the database of your references), is to
regularly backup your full Firefox or Standalone profile as part of your
backup routine for your computer (and if you’re not doing that, then you
should start right now!).
