pagetitle: A Multilingual Zotero Guide

The lessons linked to the right have been adapted from tutorial pages
prepared by Dr. Sharon Howard for Zotero training sessions at the
British Library. The content has been adjusted and extended where
necessary to cover the special features of Multilingual Zotero.

These pages are used for training sessions in our faculty. Feel free
to adapt them for your own purposes, with an acknowledgement to
myself (Frank Bennett) and Dr. Howard.
