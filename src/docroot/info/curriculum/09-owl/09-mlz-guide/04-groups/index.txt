# Personal Libraries

People use their libraries for a wide range of items -- not just academic
references -- and organise them in a multitude of ways. A brief guide
can’t really do this justice, so the best way to find out more is to
explore for yourself!

A few examples:

-   [Sharon Howard](http://www.zotero.org/sharonhoward/items)
-   [Tim Sherratt](http://www.zotero.org/wragge)
-   [Frank Bennett](http://www.zotero.org/fbennett/items)

Consider:

-   Different kinds of items saved in libraries
-   Different organisation methods, collections and tagging
-   Use of the social features (following/followers)
-   Use and membership of groups

# Group Libraries

As with personal libraries, there are many uses for Groups. A "Group"
Library can simply be used as a way to publish and share an individual’s
bibliography more visibly than if it’s in a personal library: it doesn’t
have to be a collaborative affair at all. Nonetheless, collaborative
bibliographies are an important feature facilitated by Groups.

-   See Sharon Howard's 
    [GroupCollaboration](http://sharonhoward.org/zoterowiki/Main/GroupCollaboration)
    for examples of different uses for teaching and research.

## Creating a new group

Groups are created on the Zotero website. Groups that you own and
groups that you have joined as a member will appear in your MLZ client
when you sync your account. There are two ways to get started with
creating a group:

-   Click on the New Group button (top left) in the MLZ client
    (this will take you to the website)
-   Or click on "Create a New Group" at
    [http://www.zotero.org/groups/](http://www.zotero.org/groups/)

![](/en/image/newgroup.jpg){: class="clear"}

This is a simple process, but you should take note of the
different privacy settings for libraries:

Completely Public
: anyone can view and join and edit

Public to View
: invitation only to join and edit

Completely Private
: invitation only to view or edit

When setting up a Group, ensure you have the settings the way you want
them!

## Adding items to a Group library

Some groups are read-only to ordinary members. If you have write permissions
to a group library, you can add items to it (and delete items -- but be careful
with that, other users will not be happy if content they need suddenly disappears).
(If you need write access to a library, contact the administrator to negotiate
for permission.)

There are two ways to add items to a group library:

\1. Put items in your personal library first and then copy (drag and
drop) to the group library in your MLZ pane.

-   **NB:** this creates a completely separate copy of the item; any
    subsequent changes you make to the copy in your personal library
    will *not* affect the copy in the group library.

\2. Or just add them straight to the group library.

-   In the MLZ pane, open the library’s folder, and then import the
    item. It should import straight into that library.
-   You can also add items at zotero.org

To copy items from a Group library into your personal library in the
MLZ pane, just drag and drop whichever items you want. Again, this
will create new copies completely separate from those in the group
library.

## Editing queues

Group libraries meant for public consumption may have a separate
partner library used as a submission queue. The Japanese Judgments
and Rulings group is an example of this kind:

* [Japanese Judgments and Rulings](https://www.zotero.org/groups/japanese_judgments_and_rulings/items)
* [Japanese Judgments and Rulings (submissions)](https://www.zotero.org/groups/japanese_judgments_and_rulings_submissions/items)

![](/en/image/edited-group-library.png){: class="clear"}

The submission queue is where the editors accept and edit
contributions from members before approving them for "full" public
release. In such groups, membership with editing privileges in the
submission queue group is relatively open, while only the editors have
write permissions to the full public library.

## Duplicates

In group collaborations it’s likely that sooner or later two people will
add the same reference to a library. Don’t worry too much about it.
MLZ will save them both and they can be tidied up afterwards using
the ‘Merge’ function in the MLZ pane (select both items and
right-click for the dialogue).
