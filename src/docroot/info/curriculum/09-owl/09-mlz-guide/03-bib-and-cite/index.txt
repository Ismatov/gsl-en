# Plain Bibliographies

It is quite simple to create and export formatted bibliographies for use
in documents, web pages, etc.

-   Right-click on the collection, item or selection of items you want
    in your bibliography
-   Select “Create Bibliography From Collection/Items”
-   Choose desired citation style, output mode, and output method.
-   If you choose a “save as…” or “print” option you’ll get the relevant
    dialogue; if you choose “copy to clipboard”, just paste into a
    document.
-   If you paste into a word processor document, GoogleDoc or rich text
    editing box in a browser - eg the visual editor in WordPress - it
    should keep all the formatting intact.

# Citation Styles

Both MLZ and Zotero come with a small selection of commonly-used
citation styles for bibliographies and citations preinstalled.
Further styles can be added to either tool, but it is important
to understand the difference between "standard CSL" styles written for
Zotero, and "CSL-m" styles written for MLZ.

CSL stands for "Citation Style Language", a format for defining
computerised citation styles. Standard CSL styles are recognised by
Zotero and several other reference managers. The [Zotero Style Repository](http://www.zotero.org/support/styles)
contains over 6,000 styles, covering a wide range of publishers and
academic journals. Any of the styles in the Repository can be installed
and used in Zotero.

CSL-m stands for "Citation Style Language - Multilingual". This is a
modified version of the CSL format, with added support for legal and
multilingual references. The
[CitationStylist](http://citationstylist.org/tools) website offers a
small collection of CSL-m styles. For ease of recognition, the names
of CSL-m styles begin with "MLZ" These are recognised only by MLZ:
they cannot be used with official Zotero.

Official CSL styles can be installed in MLZ, but where there is a choice,
CSL-m styles should be used instead.

With those points in mind, feel free to extend MLZ with additional
styles and experiment with the output. The ability to switch citation
styles is one of the most power features of Zotero and MLZ, and you
should not hesitate to change things around.

If you run into a problem and seek support on the Zotero forums,
be sure to put "\[MLZ\]" in the title of your post, so that it will
be picked up by the right people.

# Word Processor Integration

## MS Word and OpenOffice

MLZ uses the same word processor plugins as official Zotero. To install
a plugin, just visit the [Installing Word Processor Plugins for Zotero page](http://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_installation),
and select the plugin you need for your system.

The three plugins (for LibreOffice, and for the Mac and Windows versions of Word) all work in the same way.

To access the buttons:

-   in Word 2008 for Mac the script menu is used; in Word 2010, the
    MLZ toolbar is in the “Add-Ins” tab on the ribbon
-   in Open/LibreOffice the buttons are in the main toolbar

# Citations

Two methods for inserting citations into a document are available in
MLZ and Zotero. By default, MLZ uses the "Classic View" method,
while Zotero offers the "QuickFormat" method when first installed.
If you prefer, these settings can be changed.

Regardless of which method is used, the first time you click the
"new citation" button in a document, you will need to choose your
desired citation style:

## Classic View method

When first installed, MLZ uses the "Classic View" method. 

![](/en/image/mlz-classic-view.png){: class='clear'}

To add multiple cites to a single citation, click the **Multiple
Sources** button, then use the left/right arrow buttons that appear to
add citations from your libraries. You can also change the order of
the selected cites in the right-hand list using up/down buttons.

## QuickFormat method

\1. Place cursor in document where you want the citation and click on
the "new citation" button (you do not need to create a footnote manually -- 
MLZ will do that automatically).

\2. In the small popup window that appears:

-   start typing an author or title for suggestions from your MLZ
    database
-   select the correct reference
-   click in shaded text to open the page number/prefix/suffix dialogue
-   hit Enter when done

**See:**

-   [Using MLZ with word processor plugins](http://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage)

## Editing citations

For both entry methods, you can change the items in the selected
citation by placing the cursor in it and using the "edit citation"
button.

You can edit the formatted text of citations in the document manually,
but *this is not recommended*. When you change the text of a citation by
hand without using MLZ, it is "frozen". It will not update correctly
if you add or remove other citations that trigger a formatting change
under the rules of the citation style.

If you place the cursor in a modified citation and click the "edit citation" button,
you will get a message like this:

![](/en/image/mlz-modified-citation.png){: class='clear'}

Clicking **OK** will override your manual changes and reinsert the automatically
generated MLZ citation text.

# Bibliography

## Adding a bibliography

You can add a bibliography to your document at any time, by placing
the cursor at the location where you wish to insert the text, and
clicking the "new bibliography" button.

Bibliographies inserted in this way are "live", just like MLZ citations:
the text will change as you add and remove citations in the document.
This can slow things down, so it makes sense to omit the bibliography
until the final stage of document preparation.

After inserting the bibliography, you may find that the text requires
some adjustment. For example, the bibliography may contain a mixture
of references to statutes, court decisions, and secondary materials
that you wish to place under separate headings. For a bibliography
without numbered entries, the following steps work well:

\1. Make a copy of your document, with a file name that shows it is
    a final, non-MLZ version.
\2. Use the "remove Zotero codes" button to remove *all* MLZ codes
    from the document. The document will no longer connect to MLZ.
\3. Make your final changes manually.

# GoogleDocs and other software

Users of GoogleDocs, Scrivener, and any other wordprocessing software
that uses the OpenDocument .ODF format now have the option of using the
RTF/ODF-Scan for Zotero plugin. See the links below for further information.

-   [Announcing RTF/ODF-Scan for Zotero](http://zoteromusings.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/announcing-rtfodf-scan-for-zotero/)
