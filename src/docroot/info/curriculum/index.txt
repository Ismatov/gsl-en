title: Curriculum

Course lists for individual programs are available to the right. The
LL.M. (Comparative Law) is taught in two separate streams, in English
and Japanese respectively. The Overseas Postgraduate Student Handbook
covers both the LL.M. and LL.D. degrees of the Comparative Law
curriculum.

The Leading Graduate School program is largely composed of compulsory
subjects, but project work is an important element of the curriculum
and the "On-Demand" seminars provide flexibility for students with
particular objectives.

The Global 30 Program is a University-wide undergraduate degree, with
Law and Politics as one of the major subjects. The list linked to the
right is of courses offered under the "G30" program within our faculty.

The Economics courses linked to the right are available as external
units within the LL.M. (Comparative Law) program. Please see the
Overseas Postgraduate Student Handbook for details.
