In association with the Graduate School of Law, home students
in undergraduate and graduate programs formed the School of
Law Volunteers (SOLV) in October 1999, which aims to
support overseas students in in the adjustment to life
in Japan.  SOLV coordinates a number of social events
each year, and many of its members serve more formally
as tutors to overseas students in language and law.
Many overseas students will have an
immediate and early opportunity to benefit from SOLV
outreach at the flea market that takes place at the beginning
of each academic term.  See the top of the Directory area
of this website for the [contact details for SOLV][solv].

# Sports facilities

A number of sports facilities are available on campus, including
tennis courts, sports grounds, and the University swimming
pool.  For information on how to make reservations, 
or to check about opening hours or the terms of use, 
please refer to the [Education Center for
International Students (ECIS)][ecis] website.  (The information
on sports facilities is under "Information for International
Students" &rarr; "Daily life" &rarr; "Student life".)

Opening hours
of the University swimming pool are maintained by the
[Research Center for Health, Physical Fitness and Sports][sports].
As the website of the latter has only Japanese content, it may
be more convenient to ask a Japanese classmate about opening
hours of the pool.

## Ski trips

Trips organized by Graduate School of Law staff during the year 
are an important opportunity for students to meet classmates
from other countries, and to experience Japan beyond
the City of Nagoya.  Ski trips to the North end of Aichi Prefecture,
held in most years since 1999,
are a shared experience between students from countries that
receive far more snow than Nagoya, and those seeing snow
for the first time.

## Field trips

Field trips to important national landmarks are also arranged
in most years.  Groups visited Kyoto in 2001 and in 2004,
and the Tango region of Kyoto in 2003.  Excursions covering
the Shin-Hodaka hot springs region in Gifu Prefecture,
the historical town of Takayama, and the Ise Shrine were
made in 2005.  In the following year, students travelled by ferry to
the island of Kyushu, and by bus to Hiroshima.
In 2007, destinations included the Japanese Supreme Court and
the National Diet in Tokyo, and a hot springs resort in
Yamanashi Prefecture.
