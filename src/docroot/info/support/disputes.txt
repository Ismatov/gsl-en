automobiles, including motorcycles, in Japan,
because of the risk of accident and the serious consequences
that can follow.  However, if
you are involved in an automobile accident, either as
a driver or as a victim, the [Nagoya Automobile Insurance
Claims Consulting Center][claims] provides a free service
for resolving disputes and settling claims.
