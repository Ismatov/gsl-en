## Insurance for Automobiles and Motorcycles

International students are strongly advised against driving automobiles,
including motorcycles, in Japan. (JDS and JICA fellows are prohibited
from driving such vehicles.)

Traffic accidents commonly result in obligations that 
exceed the individual's ability to pay the costs,
unless covered by both compulsory automobile liability insurance,
(*jibaiseki-hoken* in Japanese) 
and voluntary automobile insurance (*nin'i-hoken*).

Under
the Automobile Liability Security Law, 
every operator of a motor vehicle or motorcycle is required
to take out a compulsory automobile liability insurance (CALI)
policy.  Failure to do so will result in punishment under
this law.  The CALI policy attaches to the vehicle.
Because motorcycles and light automobiles 
are exempted from periodic vehicle inspections,
the owner or the user may be unaware whether the CALI policy
has been taken out for that vehicle.  *It is the operator's
responsibility to be certain that the CALI policy is up to date.*

The [Nagoya University Co-op][coopins] provides some options for this form of insurance.

## Supplemental accident insurance

In addition, we strongly recommend that students purchase supplementary
private insurance
for personal accidents and sickness, including compensation for damage
to others. This insurance can be purchased at a reasonable premium
through the [University Co-op][coop].
