Title: Earthquake preparation

Japan witnesses many earthquakes. The 1995 Kansai Earthquake and the
2004 Niigata Earthquake caused immeasurable damage to these regions. It
is predicted that an earthquake of equivalent scale will also hit the
Tokai area in the foreseeable future.
There are things you can do to prepare for the possibility
of a major earthquake or other natural disaster.

A straightforward

trial basis on the first day of every month, is called
the [Disaster Emergency Dengon Dial][dengon] service.
