# Financial Aid

## Scholarships and loans

The best general reference on this subject
is the [Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO)][jasso] website,
which provides up to date details
on scholarship programs offered by Japanese sponsoring
organizations, as well as a needs-based loan program
for overseas students.

[jasso]: index.html#japan_student_services_organization_jasso

See the [Admissions][admissions] page of this website
for information about how individual scholarship
programs affect the admissions process.

[admissions]: /en/admissions

### Undergraduate study

The Embassy Recommendation screening process administered
at overseas locations by the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)][mofa]
is the only viable scholarship option for overseas
applicants.  For information on the admissions process,
please refer to the [Admissions][admissions] page of this
website.

[mofa]: /en/support/index.html#japan_ministry_of_foreign_affairs_mofa

Students applying from inside Japan may wish to explore
other scholarship option through the website of the
[Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO)][jasso].

### Postgraduate study

For overseas applicants, the principle scholarship options
are the [Japanese Grant Aid for
Human Resource Development Scholarship (JDS)][jds] scheme
and the Japanese Government (Monbukagakusho) Scholarship
offered in connection with the Nagoya University Graduate
School of Law Human Resources Development Program to
Contribute to Asian Technical Legal Assistance Projects.

[jds]: /en/support/index.html#japan_international_cooperation_center_jice

In addition to these two schemes, overseas applicants
may wish to explore the Embassy Recommendation screening
process for overseas applicants operated by the
[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)][mofa].

Both overseas applicants and students applying from
within Japan may wish to explore other scholarship options
via the [Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO)][jasso] website.

For details on how each scholarship scheme affects
the admissions process of the Nagoya University Graduate
School of Law, see the [Admissions][admissions] page
of this website.

## Fee exemptions

Recipients of the Monbukagakusho (MEXT) Scholarship receive a
complete waiver of the entrance exam fee, the registration fee, and 
of tuition.  


Independently-financed undergraduate or graduate students who
with excellent academic records
are eligible to be considered for needs-based fee exemptions of either
all or half of their tuition and registration fees.
However, please be aware that in the last few years the number of
tuition fee exemptions granted has been decreasing.

Students wishing to apply for fee exemptions are required to submit
the necessary documents during the student registration period.
Successful applicants must apply for a renewal of the exemption
every term (6 months).
The application period for the spring term is from the end of March
through to the start of April and for the autumn term it falls in the
middle part of September.

No fee exemption is available for research and auditing students.
